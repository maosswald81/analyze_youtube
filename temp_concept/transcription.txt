Transcription for 10 Places in the Solar System Where Alien Life is Possible.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:05.280000
      One could argue that almost any body in the solar system is habitable so long as you have
   Segment 2
      0:00:05.280000 ---> 0:00:09.680000
      the technology to colonize it, but that would involve this solar system's elephant in the
   Segment 3
      0:00:09.680000 ---> 0:00:11.880000
      room which is our civilization.
   Segment 4
      0:00:11.880000 ---> 0:00:14.280000
      For the sake of this list, I leave us off it.
   Segment 5
      0:00:14.280000 ---> 0:00:18.640000
      We know that life on Earth is possible, but as we've learned more about our solar system,
   Segment 6
      0:00:18.640000 ---> 0:00:23.480000
      it is becoming increasingly evident that other places could have evolved life independently
   Segment 7
      0:00:23.480000 ---> 0:00:25
      of Earth.
   Segment 8
      0:00:25 ---> 0:00:30.020000
      So here are 10 places where life is possible in this solar system other than Earth, plus
   Segment 9
      0:00:30.020000 ---> 0:00:34.880000
      a few bonuses tossed in since hypothetical habitability is by no means rare in this star
   Segment 10
      0:00:34.880000 ---> 0:00:39.240000
      system and probably isn't rare in the rest of the universe either.
   Segment 11
      0:00:39.240000 ---> 0:00:40.240000
      10.
   Segment 12
      0:00:40.240000 ---> 0:00:41.240000
      Venus
   Segment 13
      0:00:41.240000 ---> 0:00:45.980000
      This possibility is a long shot, though life can be tenacious and surprising so it remains
   Segment 14
      0:00:45.980000 ---> 0:00:48.800000
      a possibility at least for microbial life.
   Segment 15
      0:00:48.800000 ---> 0:00:53.480000
      Venus was once like Earth, it may have had abundant liquid water early in its history
   Segment 16
      0:00:53.480000 ---> 0:00:58.260000
      and seems to have had it long enough for life to arise, but the story of Venus is a sad
   Segment 17
      0:00:58.260000 ---> 0:00:59.260000
      one.
   Segment 18
      0:00:59.260000 ---> 0:01:03.520000
      Several contributing factors led to an eventual runaway greenhouse effect on that world that
   Segment 19
      0:01:03.520000 ---> 0:01:06.040000
      turned it into a vision of hell.
   Segment 20
      0:01:06.040000 ---> 0:01:10.240000
      But that transformation would have been a gradual process as far as we know, and any
   Segment 21
      0:01:10.240000 ---> 0:01:14.840000
      life that was present on the surface may have had time to adapt to the changing conditions
   Segment 22
      0:01:14.840000 ---> 0:01:17.320000
      and find a niche in which to survive.
   Segment 23
      0:01:17.320000 ---> 0:01:20.560000
      That niche lies in the upper reaches of Venus's atmosphere.
   Segment 24
      0:01:20.560000 ---> 0:01:25.840000
      There exists a zone that is temperate and cool that may allow for airborne life to exist,
   Segment 25
      0:01:25.840000 ---> 0:01:29.200000
      and it's possible that we may have already detected it.
   Segment 26
      0:01:29.200000 ---> 0:01:32.240000
      This option for microbial life is a huge maybe.
   Segment 27
      0:01:32.240000 ---> 0:01:36.360000
      Venus's atmosphere is quite acidic and this life would be radically different from most
   Segment 28
      0:01:36.360000 ---> 0:01:40.880000
      life on Earth, but there is a hypothetical way for life to exist in that kind of acidity
   Segment 29
      0:01:40.880000 ---> 0:01:44.760000
      through a molecule known as an S8 molecule.
   Segment 30
      0:01:44.760000 ---> 0:01:49.900000
      An organism could hypothetically incorporate S8 molecules as a sort of armor, as these
   Segment 31
      0:01:49.900000 ---> 0:01:53.500000
      molecules are resistant to the effects of sulfuric acid.
   Segment 32
      0:01:53.500000 ---> 0:01:58.180000
      S8 has been detected in the atmosphere of Venus and could have been put there by life.
   Segment 33
      0:01:58.180000 ---> 0:02:02.140000
      Such life could also use ultraviolet light from the sun as an energy source and oddly
   Segment 34
      0:02:02.140000 ---> 0:02:03.140000
      enough.
   Segment 35
      0:02:03.140000 ---> 0:02:08.340000
      When we look at Venus in ultraviolet, we see mysterious unexplained streaks in the atmosphere.
   Segment 36
      0:02:08.340000 ---> 0:02:12.420000
      One of the possibilities on the table for whatever causes those streaks is microbial
   Segment 37
      0:02:12.420000 ---> 0:02:13.420000
      life.
   Segment 38
      0:02:13.420000 ---> 0:02:14.420000
      9.
   Segment 39
      0:02:14.420000 ---> 0:02:17.900000
      Pluto For this option, we go from the inner solar
   Segment 40
      0:02:17.900000 ---> 0:02:20.060000
      system to the outer solar system.
   Segment 41
      0:02:20.060000 ---> 0:02:23.940000
      One of the most surprising discoveries of recent years was that Pluto and its moons
   Segment 42
      0:02:23.940000 ---> 0:02:29.340000
      Sharon were not merely frozen solid worlds, but in fact dynamic bodies with active geology
   Segment 43
      0:02:29.340000 ---> 0:02:33.180000
      and even a biotic organic chemistry occurring.
   Segment 44
      0:02:33.180000 ---> 0:02:37.060000
      With this, Pluto has gone from seemingly being one of the last places you would expect to
   Segment 45
      0:02:37.060000 ---> 0:02:40.500000
      find life to one where it is hypothetically possible.
   Segment 46
      0:02:40.500000 ---> 0:02:43.300000
      For life, you need energy, organics, and water.
   Segment 47
      0:02:43.300000 ---> 0:02:47.660000
      Pluto has all three, though on the surface the water is frozen, but it may have a liquid
   Segment 48
      0:02:47.660000 ---> 0:02:52.940000
      water ocean beneath the surface heated by radioactive decay in the planet's core.
   Segment 49
      0:02:52.940000 ---> 0:02:57.180000
      This has potentially enormous implications for life in the solar system.
   Segment 50
      0:02:57.180000 ---> 0:03:01.380000
      Pluto is thought to essentially be a nothing special Kuiper belt object, one of hundreds
   Segment 51
      0:03:01.380000 ---> 0:03:06.140000
      or thousands, but if it does have that mix of radioactive decay and subsurface liquid
   Segment 52
      0:03:06.140000 ---> 0:03:10.460000
      water, then potentially many Kuiper belt objects have this as well.
   Segment 53
      0:03:10.460000 ---> 0:03:14.420000
      If that's the case, then we may someday discover hundreds of new candidates for life
   Segment 54
      0:03:14.420000 ---> 0:03:16.180000
      in the solar system.
   Segment 55
      0:03:16.180000 ---> 0:03:17.180000
      8.
   Segment 56
      0:03:17.180000 ---> 0:03:18.180000
      Titan
   Segment 57
      0:03:18.180000 ---> 0:03:22.980000
      Speaking of Kuiper belt objects, our next candidate is thought to also have originated
   Segment 58
      0:03:22.980000 ---> 0:03:24.540000
      from the Kuiper belt.
   Segment 59
      0:03:24.540000 ---> 0:03:26.020000
      There's a good reason to think this.
   Segment 60
      0:03:26.020000 ---> 0:03:30.940000
      It orbits in the opposite direction of Neptune's rotation, suggesting that it did not form along
   Segment 61
      0:03:30.940000 ---> 0:03:32.100000
      with that planet.
   Segment 62
      0:03:32.100000 ---> 0:03:36.500000
      Plus, it looks similar to Pluto in a number of ways, but it does stand out in one very
   Segment 63
      0:03:36.500000 ---> 0:03:37.500000
      odd way.
   Segment 64
      0:03:37.500000 ---> 0:03:42.900000
      It's currently geologically active, but instead of volcanoes it has cryovolcanoes that spew
   Segment 65
      0:03:42.900000 ---> 0:03:46.580000
      out nitrogen contributing to it in the atmosphere.
   Segment 66
      0:03:46.580000 ---> 0:03:50.500000
      Another thing that sets Triton apart from most of the other moons of the solar system
   Segment 67
      0:03:50.500000 ---> 0:03:54.620000
      is that, because it was likely captured, it would have been subject to tidal heating
   Segment 68
      0:03:54.620000 ---> 0:03:57.780000
      from Neptune as it settled into a stable orbit.
   Segment 69
      0:03:57.780000 ---> 0:04:02.900000
      This could have created a Europa-like situation where there might have been subsurface oceans,
   Segment 70
      0:04:02.900000 ---> 0:04:06.020000
      and they would likely have persisted for a very long period of time.
   Segment 71
      0:04:06.020000 ---> 0:04:08.580000
      But how long are they still there?
   Segment 72
      0:04:08.580000 ---> 0:04:12.620000
      One clue is that Triton appears to have a young surface, only about 100 million years
   Segment 73
      0:04:12.620000 ---> 0:04:17.780000
      old, and may have resulted from an extrusion from the ocean below, and something is driving
   Segment 74
      0:04:17.780000 ---> 0:04:22.660000
      the cryovolcanism, so one possibility is that there is still a subsurface ocean present
   Segment 75
      0:04:22.660000 ---> 0:04:23.660000
      there.
   Segment 76
      0:04:23.660000 ---> 0:04:28.580000
      If so, it would likely be rich in ammonia, as well as water, and could contain life.
   Segment 77
      0:04:28.580000 ---> 0:04:29.580000
      Number 7.
   Segment 78
      0:04:29.580000 ---> 0:04:33.580000
      The Moons of Uranus As we work our way inward from the outer
   Segment 79
      0:04:33.580000 ---> 0:04:37.900000
      solar system, we next arrive at a planet that really doesn't get enough attention.
   Segment 80
      0:04:37.900000 ---> 0:04:39.620000
      I'll admit my own bias here.
   Segment 81
      0:04:39.620000 ---> 0:04:44.020000
      I've never talked extensively about Uranus or its moons on this channel, despite having
   Segment 82
      0:04:44.020000 ---> 0:04:47.020000
      said the word Europa like 100 times.
   Segment 83
      0:04:47.020000 ---> 0:04:51.740000
      Perhaps it's simply because Uranus is not exactly the most photogenic of the planets.
   Segment 84
      0:04:51.740000 ---> 0:04:56.620000
      All Voyager 2 saw was a featureless blue-green sphere, though subsequently clouds and other
   Segment 85
      0:04:56.620000 ---> 0:04:58.540000
      activity have been seen.
   Segment 86
      0:04:58.540000 ---> 0:05:03.460000
      As a result, not a lot of attention has been paid to this planet, but looks can be deceiving.
   Segment 87
      0:05:03.460000 ---> 0:05:07.460000
      Uranus hosts mysteries just like all other bodies in the solar system, including how
   Segment 88
      0:05:07.460000 ---> 0:05:11.980000
      it came to be that this planet rotates on its side compared to the other planets.
   Segment 89
      0:05:11.980000 ---> 0:05:17.460000
      Best guess there is that early in its history Uranus got smacked by an Earth-sized protoplanet.
   Segment 90
      0:05:17.460000 ---> 0:05:22.060000
      The first candidate moon for liquid water is Titania, though unfortunately so little
   Segment 91
      0:05:22.060000 ---> 0:05:26.380000
      is understood of this body's evolution that its candidacy is up in the air.
   Segment 92
      0:05:26.380000 ---> 0:05:31.040000
      But it is possible, at least as far as we know, for an ammonia-rich or salty liquid
   Segment 93
      0:05:31.040000 ---> 0:05:34.460000
      water layer to exist deep under this moon's surface.
   Segment 94
      0:05:34.460000 ---> 0:05:37.820000
      It's much the same story for Oberon, another candidate.
   Segment 95
      0:05:37.820000 ---> 0:05:42.180000
      We just don't know enough, but a subsurface liquid layer is on the table.
   Segment 96
      0:05:42.180000 ---> 0:05:43.780000
      Less likely is Umbriel.
   Segment 97
      0:05:43.780000 ---> 0:05:47.420000
      It's been suggested, but there doesn't seem to be much room there for anything but ice
   Segment 98
      0:05:47.420000 ---> 0:05:49.020000
      and rock.
   Segment 99
      0:05:49.020000 ---> 0:05:53.220000
      Uranus is a place where life is unlikely, but marginally possible, at least as far as
   Segment 100
      0:05:53.220000 ---> 0:05:54.540000
      current thinking.
   Segment 101
      0:05:54.540000 ---> 0:05:58.540000
      And with all candidates mentioned for Uranus, you need more than mere water for oceans to
   Segment 102
      0:05:58.540000 ---> 0:05:59.540000
      persist.
   Segment 103
      0:05:59.540000 ---> 0:06:03.580000
      You need ammonia or salt as a sort of antifreeze to keep everything liquid.
   Segment 104
      0:06:03.580000 ---> 0:06:09.420000
      But life is in principle still possible here, so on the list the Uranus system goes.
   Segment 105
      0:06:09.420000 ---> 0:06:10.780000
      6.
   Segment 106
      0:06:10.780000 ---> 0:06:12.300000
      Space Itself
   Segment 107
      0:06:12.300000 ---> 0:06:18.020000
      The last place you might choose to look for alien life is space, as an actual space itself.
   Segment 108
      0:06:18.020000 ---> 0:06:23.020000
      We tend to automatically think that life must be intrinsically linked to planets or moons,
   Segment 109
      0:06:23.020000 ---> 0:06:24.540000
      and that's certainly a fair point.
   Segment 110
      0:06:24.540000 ---> 0:06:28.900000
      It's hard to see life arising in the cold vacuum of space, but nothing says that life
   Segment 111
      0:06:28.900000 ---> 0:06:31.180000
      can't leave its planet.
   Segment 112
      0:06:31.180000 ---> 0:06:34.820000
      Being the obvious, one way to do this are rockets and spacecraft, whether you are a
   Segment 113
      0:06:34.820000 ---> 0:06:40.340000
      human intentionally going into orbit, or you're a dog or chimpanzee being put there by a human,
   Segment 114
      0:06:40.340000 ---> 0:06:45.140000
      or even a stowaway bacterium, tardigrade, or lichen unintentionally leaving Earth, either
   Segment 115
      0:06:45.140000 ---> 0:06:50.060000
      by way of a spacecraft or through various methods of natural panspermia.
   Segment 116
      0:06:50.060000 ---> 0:06:54.580000
      But the possibility of natural panspermia comes with another possibility, that life could
   Segment 117
      0:06:54.580000 ---> 0:06:57.780000
      adapt, survive, and live in space on its own.
   Segment 118
      0:06:57.780000 ---> 0:07:02.520000
      You know that certain examples of Earth life, rare though they are, can survive the conditions
   Segment 119
      0:07:02.520000 ---> 0:07:06.620000
      of space, but what of something that can go much further?
   Segment 120
      0:07:06.620000 ---> 0:07:09.700000
      Freeman Dyson envisions one such possibility.
   Segment 121
      0:07:09.700000 ---> 0:07:14.660000
      Turn Dyson sunflowers, these would be organisms that might originate on ice-shelled moons,
   Segment 122
      0:07:14.660000 ---> 0:07:18.140000
      growing up through the cracks in the ice with a connection to the water below like the roots
   Segment 123
      0:07:18.140000 ---> 0:07:19.380000
      of a plant.
   Segment 124
      0:07:19.380000 ---> 0:07:23.740000
      It might adapt itself to keep warm through natural mirrors, and might create its own supply
   Segment 125
      0:07:23.740000 ---> 0:07:25.180000
      of liquid water.
   Segment 126
      0:07:25.180000 ---> 0:07:29.140000
      It might even eventually be knocked off its planet and move into deep space and might
   Segment 127
      0:07:29.140000 ---> 0:07:30.420000
      adapt.
   Segment 128
      0:07:30.420000 ---> 0:07:33.180000
      I think this option is possible, but not probable.
   Segment 129
      0:07:33.180000 ---> 0:07:37.820000
      I doubt we would see life like this very often when exploring the universe, but it pays to
   Segment 130
      0:07:37.820000 ---> 0:07:42.220000
      remember that life often surprises us down here on Earth, and I see no reason it wouldn't
   Segment 131
      0:07:42.220000 ---> 0:07:44.660000
      surprise us in space.
   Segment 132
      0:07:44.660000 ---> 0:07:45.660000
      5.
   Segment 133
      0:07:45.660000 ---> 0:07:46.900000
      Titan
   Segment 134
      0:07:46.900000 ---> 0:07:51.300000
      Here we move to a moon that not only has one possibility for life, but two.
   Segment 135
      0:07:51.300000 ---> 0:07:55.220000
      It is a body different from all others in the solar system, safe for Earth.
   Segment 136
      0:07:55.220000 ---> 0:07:59.740000
      On its surface, it boasts liquid hydrocarbons mimicking the water cycle on Earth.
   Segment 137
      0:07:59.740000 ---> 0:08:04.460000
      It has been advanced that hydrocarbons in liquid form could serve as a solvent for life like
   Segment 138
      0:08:04.460000 ---> 0:08:06.100000
      water does for us.
   Segment 139
      0:08:06.100000 ---> 0:08:08.780000
      This life would be very different from what we're used to.
   Segment 140
      0:08:08.780000 ---> 0:08:13.940000
      It would need to exist at much lower temperatures than here, but Titan is also so sufficiently
   Segment 141
      0:08:13.940000 ---> 0:08:17.700000
      strange that the possibility is worth consideration.
   Segment 142
      0:08:17.700000 ---> 0:08:22.620000
      One thing in favor of life on the surface of Titan are, again, abundant organics, and
   Segment 143
      0:08:22.620000 ---> 0:08:26.580000
      there may even be hints that there might be life there such as difficult to explain methane
   Segment 144
      0:08:26.580000 ---> 0:08:31.820000
      levels at the surface, though there are also natural possibilities for creating that life
   Segment 145
      0:08:31.820000 ---> 0:08:34.220000
      is merely one option.
   Segment 146
      0:08:34.220000 ---> 0:08:36.100000
      But how might that life work?
   Segment 147
      0:08:36.100000 ---> 0:08:41.020000
      One thing that's been advanced are cell membranes involving acrylonitrile that could work with
   Segment 148
      0:08:41.020000 ---> 0:08:46.900000
      liquid methane as a solvent, and, lo and behold, acrylonitrile was found to tighten by the Cassini
   Segment 149
      0:08:46.900000 ---> 0:08:47.900000
      mission.
   Segment 150
      0:08:47.900000 ---> 0:08:52.020000
      Only time and more study will tell if there is life on the surface of Titan, but it too
   Segment 151
      0:08:52.020000 ---> 0:08:56.500000
      is an ice shell moon, thought to have a liquid water, ocean, high anemonia below the surface
   Segment 152
      0:08:56.500000 ---> 0:08:59.260000
      where life may have also arisen.
   Segment 153
      0:08:59.260000 ---> 0:09:02.980000
      Perhaps there are two separate forms of life on this little orange moon.
   Segment 154
      0:09:02.980000 ---> 0:09:07.620000
      But Titan also presents an interesting future scenario where life is concerned, say it has
   Segment 155
      0:09:07.620000 ---> 0:09:09.900000
      arisen there or someday will.
   Segment 156
      0:09:09.900000 ---> 0:09:15.180000
      In the future, as the sun goes red giant, Titan may get substantially warmer and undergo a
   Segment 157
      0:09:15.220000 ---> 0:09:19.900000
      greenhouse effect, in which case the life on the former surface may extinguish, but the
   Segment 158
      0:09:19.900000 ---> 0:09:25.500000
      life below may get a few hundred million years in the sun in the form of a surface ocean.
   Segment 159
      0:09:25.500000 ---> 0:09:30.300000
      Number 4 Enceladus Enceladus is a place where the possibility
   Segment 160
      0:09:30.300000 ---> 0:09:33.220000
      of subsurface water is far more than a maybe.
   Segment 161
      0:09:33.220000 ---> 0:09:37.900000
      The stuff literally sprays out of surface cracks into deep space right before our eyes,
   Segment 162
      0:09:37.900000 ---> 0:09:42.500000
      and it's very nutritious water for life as we know it, very likely made so by subsurface
   Segment 163
      0:09:42.500000 ---> 0:09:44.060000
      volcanic vents.
   Segment 164
      0:09:44.060000 ---> 0:09:47.060000
      This is a tantalizing environment, but there's a problem.
   Segment 165
      0:09:47.060000 ---> 0:09:49.700000
      It may not be old enough for life.
   Segment 166
      0:09:49.700000 ---> 0:09:53.820000
      The problem here is that some of Saturn's moons orbit in such a way that suggests that
   Segment 167
      0:09:53.820000 ---> 0:09:56.420000
      they couldn't have been doing it this way for long.
   Segment 168
      0:09:56.420000 ---> 0:10:00.780000
      It places an age on Enceladus, at least as we know it now, of about a hundred million
   Segment 169
      0:10:00.780000 ---> 0:10:01.780000
      years.
   Segment 170
      0:10:01.780000 ---> 0:10:05.660000
      That doesn't leave life much time to arise, but the question is open.
   Segment 171
      0:10:05.660000 ---> 0:10:10.220000
      However, there is one particularly odd feature of Enceladus that may be related to number
   Segment 172
      0:10:10.220000 ---> 0:10:11.660000
      one on this list.
   Segment 173
      0:10:11.660000 ---> 0:10:13.780000
      Do you see those cracks on the surface?
   Segment 174
      0:10:13.780000 ---> 0:10:17.380000
      Do you see how the extruded material is bluish, like clean ice?
   Segment 175
      0:10:17.380000 ---> 0:10:19.180000
      Take note of that for later.
   Segment 176
      0:10:19.180000 ---> 0:10:23.820000
      But in the end, even if there is no life there now, Enceladus seems well suited for it to
   Segment 177
      0:10:23.820000 ---> 0:10:28.380000
      her eyes, leading to the possibility that it may someday be a laboratory where the human
   Segment 178
      0:10:28.380000 ---> 0:10:32.460000
      race watches the advent of alien life in real time.
   Segment 179
      0:10:32.460000 ---> 0:10:33.540000
      3.
   Segment 180
      0:10:33.540000 ---> 0:10:37.820000
      The Moons of Jupiter Moving from the Saturn system to Jupiter,
   Segment 181
      0:10:37.820000 ---> 0:10:42.980000
      we find a place where all four major Galilean moons can hypothetically host life.
   Segment 182
      0:10:42.980000 ---> 0:10:47.620000
      This likely here is Io, it's wildly volcanic, but it is warm and it is thought to have
   Segment 183
      0:10:47.620000 ---> 0:10:53.580000
      once had water, so maybe something clings to existence deep in a moist lava tube.
   Segment 184
      0:10:53.580000 ---> 0:10:58.660000
      Also included here is Callisto, a rather ignored moon that could host a subsurface ocean.
   Segment 185
      0:10:58.660000 ---> 0:11:01.580000
      Then there is Ganymede, the largest of Jupiter's moons.
   Segment 186
      0:11:01.580000 ---> 0:11:05.420000
      Current thinking is that it doesn't just have one ocean, but several, all stacked,
   Segment 187
      0:11:05.420000 ---> 0:11:09.780000
      one on top of each other, separated by layers of various forms of water ice.
   Segment 188
      0:11:09.780000 ---> 0:11:12.460000
      Think of it like a high-rise building with different floors.
   Segment 189
      0:11:12.460000 ---> 0:11:17.420000
      Many of these oceans may harbor life and may even host different ecosystems that interact
   Segment 190
      0:11:17.420000 ---> 0:11:18.700000
      through cracks in the ice.
   Segment 191
      0:11:18.700000 ---> 0:11:22.660000
      I'm sure you've noticed that I ignored the obvious candidate for life in the Jupiter
   Segment 192
      0:11:22.660000 ---> 0:11:23.660000
      system.
   Segment 193
      0:11:23.660000 ---> 0:11:26.660000
      I did that on purpose as it tops this list.
   Segment 194
      0:11:26.660000 ---> 0:11:27.660000
      2.
   Segment 195
      0:11:27.660000 ---> 0:11:31.060000
      Mars In both science and the world of science fiction,
   Segment 196
      0:11:31.060000 ---> 0:11:35.580000
      Mars has always occupied a prominent place as far as pondering extraterrestrial life is
   Segment 197
      0:11:35.580000 ---> 0:11:36.660000
      concerned.
   Segment 198
      0:11:36.660000 ---> 0:11:40.260000
      There is something alluring about it, the red planet, that in some ways looks very much
   Segment 199
      0:11:40.260000 ---> 0:11:45.180000
      like Earth, the solar system's ultimate abode for life, but also strangely alien.
   Segment 200
      0:11:45.180000 ---> 0:11:50.260000
      It's like an alternative Earth in a way, a twin that isn't identical but similar enough
   Segment 201
      0:11:50.260000 ---> 0:11:51.860000
      to be a little spooky.
   Segment 202
      0:11:51.860000 ---> 0:11:54.620000
      But that similarity extends to the scientific.
   Segment 203
      0:11:54.620000 ---> 0:11:59.260000
      Mars was once a habitat very much like Earth with abundant liquid water.
   Segment 204
      0:11:59.260000 ---> 0:12:03.700000
      Now it is cold and dry, and in fact the famous streaks that were thought to be evidence of
   Segment 205
      0:12:03.700000 ---> 0:12:07.140000
      salty seeping water on the surface is now in question.
   Segment 206
      0:12:07.140000 ---> 0:12:11.140000
      Still liquid water could persist on this planet deep below in aquifers, allowing a
   Segment 207
      0:12:11.140000 ---> 0:12:14.620000
      refuge for life that might have survived the great drying.
   Segment 208
      0:12:14.620000 ---> 0:12:19.780000
      But it would almost certainly be microbial in nature, but in the end, life is life.
   Segment 209
      0:12:19.780000 ---> 0:12:24.300000
      But what hints have we seen that something could still be hiding out on this world?
   Segment 210
      0:12:24.300000 ---> 0:12:28.840000
      First and foremost were the inconclusive Viking experiments that gave positives from metabolism
   Segment 211
      0:12:28.840000 ---> 0:12:32.100000
      and samples in an experiment designed to detect life.
   Segment 212
      0:12:32.100000 ---> 0:12:36.420000
      But unfortunately, the results were called into question and remain so today.
   Segment 213
      0:12:36.420000 ---> 0:12:40.900000
      As anyone's guess if they did detect life, and it's also debatable as to how surface
   Segment 214
      0:12:40.900000 ---> 0:12:44.580000
      life could exist in such a harsh radioactive environment.
   Segment 215
      0:12:44.580000 ---> 0:12:46.220000
      But there's more.
   Segment 216
      0:12:46.220000 ---> 0:12:50.780000
      It's been known for a while that something weird is going on with Mars and the gas methane.
   Segment 217
      0:12:50.780000 ---> 0:12:55.260000
      It was detected in the Martian atmosphere back in 2009, but the trouble is that methane
   Segment 218
      0:12:55.260000 ---> 0:12:59.380000
      is destroyed in that environment, so something must be replenishing it.
   Segment 219
      0:12:59.380000 ---> 0:13:03.980000
      The mystery deepened when the Curiosity rover detected a massive tenfold rise in methane
   Segment 220
      0:13:03.980000 ---> 0:13:08.700000
      levels at its location at Gale Crater, only to then see the levels drop back down to
   Segment 221
      0:13:08.700000 ---> 0:13:10.040000
      normal.
   Segment 222
      0:13:10.040000 ---> 0:13:14.180000
      There are natural ways for this methane to be released geologically, but it also happens
   Segment 223
      0:13:14.180000 ---> 0:13:18.860000
      to be that methane is also a gas associated with active life.
   Segment 224
      0:13:18.860000 ---> 0:13:23.940000
      Number 1 Europa Europa probably has the best chances of harboring
   Segment 225
      0:13:23.940000 ---> 0:13:29.060000
      life in the solar system other than Earth, and that life may even be more than microbial.
   Segment 226
      0:13:29.060000 ---> 0:13:32.980000
      It has a subsurface liquid water ocean that interacts with its surface.
   Segment 227
      0:13:32.980000 ---> 0:13:37.180000
      It has geysers that periodically spew materials from the ocean below into space.
   Segment 228
      0:13:37.180000 ---> 0:13:41.980000
      It has an energy source in the form of geothermal energy from tidal flexing, and essentially
   Segment 229
      0:13:41.980000 ---> 0:13:46.300000
      it has, as far as we know, the right mix for life to arise.
   Segment 230
      0:13:46.300000 ---> 0:13:48.660000
      And we may have already seen evidence of it.
   Segment 231
      0:13:48.660000 ---> 0:13:53.420000
      In 2003, a team led by Brad Dalton looked at the infrared signatures of the cracks in
   Segment 232
      0:13:53.420000 ---> 0:13:56.620000
      Europa's surface where odd discolourations are visible.
   Segment 233
      0:13:56.620000 ---> 0:14:01.340000
      He then compared that with microorganisms here on Earth located around geothermal springs
   Segment 234
      0:14:01.340000 ---> 0:14:02.780000
      at Yellowstone.
   Segment 235
      0:14:02.780000 ---> 0:14:06.900000
      They matched, opening the possibility that the discolourations are due to the presence
   Segment 236
      0:14:06.900000 ---> 0:14:10.780000
      of frozen microorganisms from the ocean below.
   Segment 237
      0:14:10.780000 ---> 0:14:15.500000
      Taking it further, Dalton took extremophile microorganisms native to Earth and put them
   Segment 238
      0:14:15.500000 ---> 0:14:18.300000
      in conditions similar to what's found on Europa.
   Segment 239
      0:14:18.300000 ---> 0:14:23.100000
      He looked again in infrared, and there were still correlations, but not a perfect match.
   Segment 240
      0:14:23.100000 ---> 0:14:27.380000
      A mineralogical answer was looked at, yet no combination of salts fit either.
   Segment 241
      0:14:27.380000 ---> 0:14:31.860000
      Yet the pink and brown discoloration of the cracks itself might be telling.
   Segment 242
      0:14:31.860000 ---> 0:14:35.740000
      The cracks should appear white, yet the extremophiles used in Dalton's experiments
   Segment 243
      0:14:35.740000 ---> 0:14:37.940000
      are colored pink and brown.
   Segment 244
      0:14:37.940000 ---> 0:14:42.540000
      While this is by no means conclusive, the discolourations could well be mineralogical.
   Segment 245
      0:14:42.540000 ---> 0:14:47.180000
      The mystery probably won't be solved completely until we can get samples of Europa's ice
   Segment 246
      0:14:47.180000 ---> 0:14:49.260000
      or drill into the ocean itself.
   Segment 247
      0:14:49.260000 ---> 0:14:53.460000
      But if I had to bet on any body in the solar system hosting life other than Earth, I'd
   Segment 248
      0:14:53.460000 ---> 0:14:55.220000
      bet on Europa.
   Segment 249
      0:14:55.220000 ---> 0:14:57.060000
      But back to Enceladus for a moment.
   Segment 250
      0:14:57.060000 ---> 0:14:59.900000
      Europa and Enceladus are very similar moons.
   Segment 251
      0:14:59.900000 ---> 0:15:03.800000
      One has cracks with staining present, the other does not have that staining.
   Segment 252
      0:15:03.800000 ---> 0:15:08.540000
      What is so radically different between these otherwise very similar objects?
   Segment 253
      0:15:08.540000 ---> 0:15:09.540000
      Thanks for listening.
   Segment 254
      0:15:09.540000 ---> 0:15:13.020000
      I am futurist and science fiction author John Michael Godier currently musing.
   Segment 255
      0:15:13.020000 ---> 0:15:16.860000
      If you watch a lot of space science press conferences like I do, you notice that they
   Segment 256
      0:15:16.860000 ---> 0:15:19.380000
      often consist largely of thanking people.
   Segment 257
      0:15:19.380000 ---> 0:15:23.500000
      But they never thank the object they're studying, so let me take a moment to publicly thank Jupiter
   Segment 258
      0:15:23.500000 ---> 0:15:24.940000
      for its awesomeness.
   Segment 259
      0:15:24.940000 ---> 0:15:28.060000
      Keep up the good work, champ, and be sure to check out my books at your favorite online
   Segment 260
      0:15:28.060000 ---> 0:15:31.860000
      book retailer and subscribe to my channel for regular and depth explorations into the
   Segment 261
      0:15:31.860000 ---> 0:15:35.460000
      interesting, weird, and unknown aspects of this amazing universe in which we live.

Transcription for 3 moons and a planet that could have alien life # James Green.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:17
      Is there life beyond Earth in our solar system?
   Segment 2
      0:00:17 ---> 0:00:20
      Wow, what a powerful question.
   Segment 3
      0:00:20 ---> 0:00:28
      You know, as a scientist, planetary scientist, we really didn't take that very seriously until recently.
   Segment 4
      0:00:28 ---> 0:00:37
      You know, Carl Sagan always said, it takes extraordinary evidence for extraordinary claims.
   Segment 5
      0:00:37 ---> 0:00:51
      And the claims of having life beyond Earth need to be definitive, they need to be loud, and they need to be everywhere for us to be able to believe it.
   Segment 6
      0:00:51 ---> 0:00:54
      So, how do we make this journey?
   Segment 7
      0:00:54 ---> 0:01:00
      What we decided to do is first look for those ingredients for life.
   Segment 8
      0:01:00 ---> 0:01:06
      The ingredients of life are liquid water. We have to have a solvent.
   Segment 9
      0:01:06 ---> 0:01:11
      Can't be ice, has to be liquid. We also have to have energy.
   Segment 10
      0:01:11 ---> 0:01:19
      We also have to have organic material, things that make us up, but also things that we need to consume.
   Segment 11
      0:01:19 ---> 0:01:34
      So, we have to have these elements in environments for long periods of time for us to be able to be confident that life in that moment when it starts can spark and then grow and evolve.
   Segment 12
      0:01:34 ---> 0:01:48
      Well, I have to tell you that early in my career, when we look at those three elements, I didn't believe that they were beyond Earth in any length of time and for any real quantity.
   Segment 13
      0:01:48 ---> 0:01:53
      Why? We look at the inner planets. Venus is way too high. It's got no water.
   Segment 14
      0:01:53 ---> 0:01:57
      Mars, dry and arid. It's got no water.
   Segment 15
      0:01:57 ---> 0:02:03
      And beyond Mars, the water in the solar system is all frozen.
   Segment 16
      0:02:03 ---> 0:02:07
      But recent observations have changed all that.
   Segment 17
      0:02:07 ---> 0:02:17
      It's now turning our attention to the right places for us to take a deeper look and really start to answer our life question.
   Segment 18
      0:02:17 ---> 0:02:22
      So, when we look out into the solar system, where are the possibilities?
   Segment 19
      0:02:22 ---> 0:02:38
      We're concentrating our attention on four locations, the planet Mars, and then three moons of the outer planets, Titan, Europa and small Enceladus.
   Segment 20
      0:02:38 ---> 0:02:43
      So, what about Mars? Let's go through the evidence.
   Segment 21
      0:02:44 ---> 0:02:49
      Well, Mars, we thought, was initially moon-like, full of craters.
   Segment 22
      0:02:49 ---> 0:02:53
      Arid, in a dead world.
   Segment 23
      0:02:53 ---> 0:03:05
      And so, about 15 years ago, we started a series of missions to go to Mars and see if water existed on Mars in its past that changed its geology.
   Segment 24
      0:03:05 ---> 0:03:08
      We ought to be able to notice that.
   Segment 25
      0:03:08 ---> 0:03:12
      And indeed, we started to be surprised right away.
   Segment 26
      0:03:12 ---> 0:03:19
      Our higher resolution images show deltas and river valleys and gullies that were there in the past.
   Segment 27
      0:03:19 ---> 0:03:34
      And in fact, Curiosity, which has been roving on the surface now for about three years, has really shown us that it's sitting in an ancient river bed, where water flowed rapidly.
   Segment 28
      0:03:34 ---> 0:03:39
      And not for a little while, perhaps hundreds of millions of years.
   Segment 29
      0:03:39 ---> 0:03:43
      And if everything was there, including organics, perhaps life had started.
   Segment 30
      0:03:43 ---> 0:03:48
      Curiosity has also drilled in that red soil and brought up other material.
   Segment 31
      0:03:48 ---> 0:03:53
      And we were really excited when we saw that, because it wasn't red Mars.
   Segment 32
      0:03:53 ---> 0:03:56
      It was gray material, it's gray Mars.
   Segment 33
      0:03:56 ---> 0:03:59
      We brought it into the rover. We tasted it.
   Segment 34
      0:03:59 ---> 0:04:01
      And guess what?
   Segment 35
      0:04:01 ---> 0:04:09
      We tasted organics, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur. They were all there.
   Segment 36
      0:04:09 ---> 0:04:20
      So Mars, in its past, with a lot of water, perhaps plenty of time, could have had life, could have had that spark, could have grown.
   Segment 37
      0:04:20 ---> 0:04:24
      And is that life still there? We don't know that.
   Segment 38
      0:04:24 ---> 0:04:29
      But a few years ago, we started to look at a number of craters.
   Segment 39
      0:04:29 ---> 0:04:34
      During the summer, dark lines would appear down the sides of these craters.
   Segment 40
      0:04:34 ---> 0:04:42
      The more we looked, the more craters we saw, the more these features. We now know more than a dozen of them.
   Segment 41
      0:04:42 ---> 0:04:46
      A few months ago, the fairy tale came true.
   Segment 42
      0:04:46 ---> 0:04:50
      We announced to the world that we know what these streaks are.
   Segment 43
      0:04:50 ---> 0:04:56
      It's liquid water. These craters are weeping during the summer.
   Segment 44
      0:04:56 ---> 0:05:00
      Liquid water is flowing down these craters.
   Segment 45
      0:05:00 ---> 0:05:04
      So what are we going to do now, now that we see the water?
   Segment 46
      0:05:04 ---> 0:05:09
      Well, it tells us that Mars has all the ingredients necessary for life.
   Segment 47
      0:05:09 ---> 0:05:15
      In its past, it had perhaps two-thirds of its northern hemisphere. There was an ocean.
   Segment 48
      0:05:15 ---> 0:05:19
      It has weeping water right now, liquid water on its surface.
   Segment 49
      0:05:19 ---> 0:05:23
      It has organics. It has all the right conditions.
   Segment 50
      0:05:23 ---> 0:05:28
      So what are we going to do next? We're going to launch a series of missions
   Segment 51
      0:05:28 ---> 0:05:32
      to begin that search for life on Mars.
   Segment 52
      0:05:32 ---> 0:05:35
      It now is more appealing than ever before.
   Segment 53
      0:05:35 ---> 0:05:41
      As we move out into the solar system, here's the tiny moon in Salatus.
   Segment 54
      0:05:41 ---> 0:05:47
      You know, this is not what we call the traditional habitable zone, this area around the sun.
   Segment 55
      0:05:47 ---> 0:05:54
      This is much further out. This object should be ice over a silicate core.
   Segment 56
      0:05:54 ---> 0:06:00
      But what did we find? Cassini was there since 2006, and after a couple years,
   Segment 57
      0:06:00 ---> 0:06:05
      look back after it flew by in Salatus and surprise this all.
   Segment 58
      0:06:05 ---> 0:06:11
      In Salatus is blasting sheets of water out into the solar system
   Segment 59
      0:06:11 ---> 0:06:16
      and sloshing back down onto the moon. What a fabulous environment.
   Segment 60
      0:06:16 ---> 0:06:23
      Cassini just a few months ago also flew through the plume, and it measured silicate particles.
   Segment 61
      0:06:23 ---> 0:06:28
      Where does the silica come from? It must come from the ocean floor.
   Segment 62
      0:06:28 ---> 0:06:34
      The tidal energy that's generated by Saturn, pulling and squeezing this moon
   Segment 63
      0:06:34 ---> 0:06:40
      is melting that ice, creating an ocean. But it's also doing that to the core.
   Segment 64
      0:06:40 ---> 0:06:46
      Now the only thing that we can think of that does that here on Earth as an analogy
   Segment 65
      0:06:46 ---> 0:06:52
      are hydrothermal vents. Now hydrothermal vents deep in our ocean
   Segment 66
      0:06:52 ---> 0:06:58
      was discovered in 1977. Oceanographers were completely surprised.
   Segment 67
      0:06:58 ---> 0:07:03
      And now there's thousands of these below the ocean.
   Segment 68
      0:07:03 ---> 0:07:08
      What do we find? The oceanographers, when they go and look at these hydrothermal vents,
   Segment 69
      0:07:08 ---> 0:07:14
      are teeming with life regardless of whether the water is acidic or alkaline.
   Segment 70
      0:07:14 ---> 0:07:21
      Doesn't matter. So hydrothermal vents are a fabulous abode for life here on Earth.
   Segment 71
      0:07:21 ---> 0:07:26
      So what about in Salatus? Well, we believe because it has water
   Segment 72
      0:07:26 ---> 0:07:33
      and has had it for a significant period of time, and we believe it has hydrothermal vents
   Segment 73
      0:07:33 ---> 0:07:40
      with perhaps the right organic material. It is a place where life could exist
   Segment 74
      0:07:40 ---> 0:07:47
      and not just microbial. Maybe more complex because it's had time to evolve.
   Segment 75
      0:07:47 ---> 0:07:57
      Another moon, very similar, is Europa. Galileo visited the Jupiter system in 1996
   Segment 76
      0:07:57 ---> 0:08:01
      and made fabulous observations of Europa.
   Segment 77
      0:08:01 ---> 0:08:07
      Now Europa, we also know, has an under the ice crust ocean.
   Segment 78
      0:08:07 ---> 0:08:13
      Galileo mission told us that. But we never saw any plumes, but we didn't look for them.
   Segment 79
      0:08:13 ---> 0:08:21
      Hubble, just a couple years ago, observing Europa saw plumes of water
   Segment 80
      0:08:21 ---> 0:08:29
      sprained from the cracks in the southern hemisphere just exactly like in Salatus.
   Segment 81
      0:08:29 ---> 0:08:35
      These moons, which are not in what we call a traditional habitable zone
   Segment 82
      0:08:35 ---> 0:08:39
      that are out in the solar system, have liquid water.
   Segment 83
      0:08:39 ---> 0:08:43
      And if there's organics there, there may be life.
   Segment 84
      0:08:43 ---> 0:08:49
      This is a fabulous set of discoveries because these moons have been in this environment
   Segment 85
      0:08:49 ---> 0:08:56
      like that for billions of years. Life started here on Earth, we believe,
   Segment 86
      0:08:56 ---> 0:09:01
      after about the first 500 million and look where we are.
   Segment 87
      0:09:01 ---> 0:09:08
      These moons are fabulous moons. Another moon that we're looking at is Titan.
   Segment 88
      0:09:08 ---> 0:09:15
      Titan is a huge moon of Saturn. It perhaps is much larger than the planet Mercury.
   Segment 89
      0:09:15 ---> 0:09:21
      It has an extensive atmosphere. It's so extensive and it's mostly nitrogen
   Segment 90
      0:09:21 ---> 0:09:25
      with a little methane and ethane that you have to peer through it with radar.
   Segment 91
      0:09:25 ---> 0:09:29
      And on the surface, Cassini has found liquid.
   Segment 92
      0:09:29 ---> 0:09:36
      We see lakes actually almost the size of our black sea in some places.
   Segment 93
      0:09:36 ---> 0:09:42
      And this area is not liquid water, it's methane.
   Segment 94
      0:09:42 ---> 0:09:47
      If there's any place in the solar system where life is not like us,
   Segment 95
      0:09:47 ---> 0:09:54
      where the substitute of water is another solvent and it could be methane, it could be Titan.
   Segment 96
      0:09:54 ---> 0:09:59
      Well, is there life beyond Earth and the solar system?
   Segment 97
      0:09:59 ---> 0:10:02
      We don't know yet, but we're hot on the pursuit.
   Segment 98
      0:10:02 ---> 0:10:06
      The data that we're receiving is really exciting and telling us,
   Segment 99
      0:10:06 ---> 0:10:11
      forcing us to think about this in new and exciting ways.
   Segment 100
      0:10:11 ---> 0:10:17
      I believe we're on the right track that in the next 10 years we will answer that question.
   Segment 101
      0:10:17 ---> 0:10:25
      And if we answer it and it's positive, then life is everywhere in the solar system.
   Segment 102
      0:10:25 ---> 0:10:31
      Just think about that. We may not be alone. Thank you.
   Segment 103
      0:10:31 ---> 0:10:39
      APPLAUSE

Transcription for Death From Space — Gamma-Ray Bursts Explained.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:05.400000
      Imagine if you could gather the energy from every style within a hundred million light-years,
   Segment 2
      0:00:05.400000 ---> 0:00:09.800000
      from thousands of galaxies each with billions of stars.
   Segment 3
      0:00:09.800000 ---> 0:00:16
      Imagine you could take this kind of power and use it to fire the biggest superweapon in the universe.
   Segment 4
      0:00:16 ---> 0:00:19
      Imagine the damage you could do.
   Segment 5
      0:00:19 ---> 0:00:21.800000
      It turns out you don't need to imagine it.
   Segment 6
      0:00:21.800000 ---> 0:00:26
      These exist and they're called gamma ray bursts.
   Segment 7
      0:00:26 ---> 0:00:28.200000
      But what are these cosmic snipers?
   Segment 8
      0:00:28.200000 ---> 0:00:32.200000
      And what happens if one takes a shot at Earth?
   Segment 9
      0:00:41.200000 ---> 0:00:46.200000
      To understand gamma ray bursts, we first have to understand gamma rays.
   Segment 10
      0:00:46.200000 ---> 0:00:52.200000
      Gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation, waves which carry energy just like visible light.
   Segment 11
      0:00:52.200000 ---> 0:00:56.200000
      Visible light is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
   Segment 12
      0:00:56.200000 ---> 0:00:59.200000
      The gamma rays are the power your eyes can see.
   Segment 13
      0:00:59.200000 ---> 0:01:04.200000
      At lower energies, there are radio waves, microwaves and infrared.
   Segment 14
      0:01:04.200000 ---> 0:01:09.200000
      And at higher energies, ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays.
   Segment 15
      0:01:09.200000 ---> 0:01:12.200000
      Gamma rays are incredibly powerful.
   Segment 16
      0:01:12.200000 ---> 0:01:18.200000
      A single gamma ray photon is more energetic than a million visible photons combined.
   Segment 17
      0:01:18.200000 ---> 0:01:23.200000
      Their high energy makes gamma rays a form of ionizing radiation,
   Segment 18
      0:01:23.200000 ---> 0:01:27.200000
      which is enough to break apart atomic bonds.
   Segment 19
      0:01:27.200000 ---> 0:01:30.200000
      This makes them dangerous to you and me.
   Segment 20
      0:01:30.200000 ---> 0:01:34.200000
      Ionizing radiation disrupts the delicate biochemical machinery that keeps us alive,
   Segment 21
      0:01:34.200000 ---> 0:01:37.200000
      like a 9mm bullet through a clock.
   Segment 22
      0:01:37.200000 ---> 0:01:40.200000
      Fortunately, on Earth, the ozone layer blocks gamma rays,
   Segment 23
      0:01:40.200000 ---> 0:01:42.200000
      filtering them out before they can harm us.
   Segment 24
      0:01:42.200000 ---> 0:01:45.200000
      But if the atmosphere blocks gamma rays from space,
   Segment 25
      0:01:45.200000 ---> 0:01:50.200000
      how were gamma ray bursts or GRBs from space ever discovered?
   Segment 26
      0:01:50.200000 ---> 0:01:57.200000
      During the Cold War, the USA sent up spy satellites which could detect gamma rays from Soviet nuclear tests in space.
   Segment 27
      0:01:57.200000 ---> 0:02:03.200000
      They didn't see any bombs, but they did observe faint bursts coming from space,
   Segment 28
      0:02:03.200000 ---> 0:02:05.200000
      lasting only a few seconds.
   Segment 29
      0:02:05.200000 ---> 0:02:12.200000
      To date, this may be the only major scientific discovery made by spy satellites that we know about anyway.
   Segment 30
      0:02:12.200000 ---> 0:02:17.200000
      Astronomers used telescopes that see different kinds of light to make their discoveries,
   Segment 31
      0:02:17.200000 ---> 0:02:19.200000
      and these spy satellites gave them a new pair of eyes.
   Segment 32
      0:02:19.200000 ---> 0:02:24.200000
      They were a mystery for 30 years, but eventually we discovered the source of a GRB,
   Segment 33
      0:02:24.200000 ---> 0:02:27.200000
      a galaxy 6 billion light years away.
   Segment 34
      0:02:27.200000 ---> 0:02:32.200000
      If a GRB can be seen from such a distance, then it must be incredibly energetic,
   Segment 35
      0:02:32.200000 ---> 0:02:38.200000
      releasing more energy in a second than the Sun will in its entire 10 billion year lifetime,
   Segment 36
      0:02:38.200000 ---> 0:02:42.200000
      making GRB's the brightest events in the universe.
   Segment 37
      0:02:42.200000 ---> 0:02:44.200000
      So, where do they come from?
   Segment 38
      0:02:45.200000 ---> 0:02:52.200000
      GRB's accompany some of the most violent cataclysmic deaths in the universe and the birth of black holes.
   Segment 39
      0:02:52.200000 ---> 0:02:58.200000
      There are two types of gamma ray bursts, short and long, and each has their own source.
   Segment 40
      0:02:58.200000 ---> 0:03:03.200000
      Long GRB's last about a minute, and scientists think they are produced by supernova,
   Segment 41
      0:03:03.200000 ---> 0:03:06.200000
      when the core of a massive star collapses to become a black hole.
   Segment 42
      0:03:06.200000 ---> 0:03:12.200000
      Short GRB's last a second, and are produced when two neutron stars in a binary merge.
   Segment 43
      0:03:12.200000 ---> 0:03:16.200000
      Over millions of years, they're all bits decay by emitting gravitational waves.
   Segment 44
      0:03:16.200000 ---> 0:03:22.200000
      Once they're close enough to touch, they crash and splash into each other, forming a black hole.
   Segment 45
      0:03:22.200000 ---> 0:03:26.200000
      Both supernova and neutron star mergers make the same thing.
   Segment 46
      0:03:26.200000 ---> 0:03:31.200000
      Black holes, surrounded by a magnetized disk of gas left over from their parent stars.
   Segment 47
      0:03:31.200000 ---> 0:03:35.200000
      In these environments, the rotation winds up the magnetic field,
   Segment 48
      0:03:35.200000 ---> 0:03:40.200000
      which funnels hot jets of particles travelling at maybe the speed of light.
   Segment 49
      0:03:40.200000 ---> 0:03:46.200000
      The gas in this funnel creates two tight jets of high energy gamma rays, like a celestial laser gun.
   Segment 50
      0:03:46.200000 ---> 0:03:54.200000
      So, unlike other cosmic explosions which spread out and fade, GRB's stay focused and can be seen from much further.
   Segment 51
      0:03:54.200000 ---> 0:03:59.200000
      Any more detail would require too much mathematics for a YouTube video.
   Segment 52
      0:03:59.200000 ---> 0:04:07.200000
      The universe is full of these cosmic snipers, firing blindly and randomly into the dark, and they're hitting us all the time.
   Segment 53
      0:04:07.200000 ---> 0:04:12.200000
      On average, we detect one per day, fortunately most are harmless.
   Segment 54
      0:04:12.200000 ---> 0:04:19.200000
      All the bursts we have detected so far originated outside the Milky Way, too far away to hurt us.
   Segment 55
      0:04:19.200000 ---> 0:04:22.200000
      But a nearby GRB could be disastrous.
   Segment 56
      0:04:22.200000 ---> 0:04:29.200000
      If one goes off within a few light years of us, it would totally cook the surface of the Earth, or at least the half that's facing it.
   Segment 57
      0:04:29.200000 ---> 0:04:33.200000
      But even a more distant GRB could still end life on Earth.
   Segment 58
      0:04:34.200000 ---> 0:04:37.200000
      And it wouldn't need to score a headshot to kill us.
   Segment 59
      0:04:37.200000 ---> 0:04:43.200000
      If originating from a few thousand light years away, it would be a hundred light years wide by the time it reaches us,
   Segment 60
      0:04:43.200000 ---> 0:04:46.200000
      washing over the soda system like a tidal wave.
   Segment 61
      0:04:47.200000 ---> 0:04:52.200000
      Again, the ozone layer protects us, but it's better equipped to handle the trickle of ultraviolet from the sun.
   Segment 62
      0:04:52.200000 ---> 0:04:58.200000
      A gamma ray burst would overwhelm it, leaving us exposed to deadly soda radiation.
   Segment 63
      0:04:58.200000 ---> 0:05:05.200000
      The ozone takes years to replenish itself by natural processes, which is more than enough time for the sun to burn the Earth's sterile,
   Segment 64
      0:05:05.200000 ---> 0:05:08.200000
      or at least to kill most complex life.
   Segment 65
      0:05:08.200000 ---> 0:05:11.200000
      In fact, this may have already happened.
   Segment 66
      0:05:11.200000 ---> 0:05:18.200000
      A GRB has been suggested as one possible cause of the Ordovician Extinction 450 million years ago
   Segment 67
      0:05:18.200000 ---> 0:05:24.200000
      that eradicated almost 85% of all marine species, although it's pretty much impossible to prove.
   Segment 68
      0:05:25.200000 ---> 0:05:29.200000
      Gamma ray bursts could even be one reason we don't see life anywhere else in the universe.
   Segment 69
      0:05:29.200000 ---> 0:05:33.200000
      They might be wiping clean huge chunks of it on a regular basis.
   Segment 70
      0:05:34.200000 ---> 0:05:41.200000
      It's been suggested that because of GRB's, only 10% of all galaxies might be hospitable to life similar to us.
   Segment 71
      0:05:42.200000 ---> 0:05:44.200000
      So, are they going to kill us?
   Segment 72
      0:05:44.200000 ---> 0:05:46.200000
      Probably not.
   Segment 73
      0:05:46.200000 ---> 0:05:50.200000
      In a galaxy like ours, there may only be one GRB per millennia,
   Segment 74
      0:05:50.200000 ---> 0:05:54.200000
      and to harm us, they must be close and directed at us.
   Segment 75
      0:05:54.200000 ---> 0:05:59.200000
      But since gamma rays travel at the speed of light, we won't know when it's headed our way until it arrives,
   Segment 76
      0:05:59.200000 ---> 0:06:06.200000
      so there could already be a GRB on its way to kill us all, and we won't know it until it hits us, and we're dead.

Transcription for Extremophiles 101 # National Geographic.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:08.440000
      Intense heat, freezing cold, high acidity, and radioactivity.
   Segment 2
      0:00:08.440000 ---> 0:00:15.120000
      These harsh environments don't seem hospitable for life, but some organisms not only survive,
   Segment 3
      0:00:15.120000 ---> 0:00:20.760000
      but thrive under such extreme conditions.
   Segment 4
      0:00:20.760000 ---> 0:00:24.680000
      The name extremophile means extreme lover.
   Segment 5
      0:00:24.680000 ---> 0:00:30.120000
      These organisms live in exceptionally harsh environments, such as hot hydrothermal vents
   Segment 6
      0:00:30.120000 ---> 0:00:34.520000
      or buried in rocks far beneath the earth's surface.
   Segment 7
      0:00:34.520000 ---> 0:00:41.280000
      Extremophiles occur in all three domains of life, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryote.
   Segment 8
      0:00:41.280000 ---> 0:00:46.640000
      They range from the extreme heat-loving thermophiles, which feed off of inorganic chemicals and
   Segment 9
      0:00:46.640000 ---> 0:00:52.880000
      have special enzymes to survive high temperatures, to extreme cold-loving psychrophiles, which
   Segment 10
      0:00:52.920000 ---> 0:00:57.680000
      have evolved antifreeze proteins that help ensure their survival in some of the coldest
   Segment 11
      0:00:57.680000 ---> 0:01:00.640000
      waters on the planet.
   Segment 12
      0:01:00.640000 ---> 0:01:05.520000
      But the most extreme living things on earth are tardigrades.
   Segment 13
      0:01:05.520000 ---> 0:01:12
      Also known as water bears, these water-dwelling microanimals are polyextremophiles.
   Segment 14
      0:01:12 ---> 0:01:16.400000
      This means they are capable of surviving multiple harsh conditions.
   Segment 15
      0:01:16.400000 ---> 0:01:21.400000
      They are nearly indestructible and have even survived the extreme conditions of outer
   Segment 16
      0:01:21.400000 ---> 0:01:23.400000
      space.
   Segment 17
      0:01:23.400000 ---> 0:01:28.520000
      Tardigrades have a unique adaptation that allows them to curl up into a dry, seemingly lifeless
   Segment 18
      0:01:28.520000 ---> 0:01:32.360000
      ball and slow down their metabolic rate.
   Segment 19
      0:01:32.360000 ---> 0:01:39.760000
      In this state, they can survive cold, dry environments, like space, for decades.
   Segment 20
      0:01:39.760000 ---> 0:01:44.520000
      Studying the adaptations of extremophiles may hold the key to solving many of earth's
   Segment 21
      0:01:44.520000 ---> 0:01:45.520000
      problems.
   Segment 22
      0:01:45.520000 ---> 0:01:51.360000
      This includes the development of genetically-based medications, producing new types of biofuels,
   Segment 23
      0:01:51.360000 ---> 0:01:55.720000
      and protecting people against radiation exposure.
   Segment 24
      0:01:55.720000 ---> 0:02:00.560000
      Extremophiles have opened our minds to the many possibilities of life and the environments
   Segment 25
      0:02:00.560000 ---> 0:02:02.400000
      that can support it.
   Segment 26
      0:02:02.400000 ---> 0:02:07.920000
      Understanding the limits of life in these extreme conditions on earth may provide scientists
   Segment 27
      0:02:07.920000 ---> 0:02:12.440000
      with clues of how life could possibly exist elsewhere in the universe.

Transcription for From the Cambrian Explosion to the Great Dying.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:07.040000
      Thank you to Audible for supporting PBS Digital Studios.
   Segment 2
      0:00:07.040000 ---> 0:00:10.840000
      Let me tell you, there are no dull moments in the story of life.
   Segment 3
      0:00:10.840000 ---> 0:00:15.960000
      Sure, within the whole geologic timescale, there may be some episodes that are less exciting
   Segment 4
      0:00:15.960000 ---> 0:00:16.960000
      than others.
   Segment 5
      0:00:16.960000 ---> 0:00:21.200000
      But the first era of our current eon, the Paleozoic Era, is probably the most deceptively
   Segment 6
      0:00:21.200000 ---> 0:00:23.600000
      fascinating time in Earth's history.
   Segment 7
      0:00:23.600000 ---> 0:00:28.740000
      I say deceptively because even though Paleozoic means ancient life, the span of time from
   Segment 8
      0:00:28.740000 ---> 0:00:34.940000
      541 million to 252 million years ago doesn't have stuff like dinosaurs or saber tooth cats.
   Segment 9
      0:00:34.940000 ---> 0:00:39.300000
      So it's often overlooked as a time of primitive and boring creatures.
   Segment 10
      0:00:39.300000 ---> 0:00:44.780000
      But the fact is, the Paleozoic Era was truly a make it or break it time for life on Earth.
   Segment 11
      0:00:44.780000 ---> 0:00:49.220000
      At the beginning of the Paleozoic, living things were extremely simple and not very
   Segment 12
      0:00:49.220000 ---> 0:00:50.220000
      dynamic.
   Segment 13
      0:00:50.220000 ---> 0:00:52.060000
      Life was fragile, vulnerable.
   Segment 14
      0:00:52.060000 ---> 0:00:57.060000
      But the Paleozoic was also easily the most chaotic of all three eras of our eon, with
   Segment 15
      0:00:57.060000 ---> 0:01:01.660000
      near constant revolutions in life, punctuated by catastrophic extinctions.
   Segment 16
      0:01:01.660000 ---> 0:01:05.900000
      In fact, by the end of this era, our planet was the closest it's ever gotten to being
   Segment 17
      0:01:05.900000 ---> 0:01:07.580000
      devoid of life altogether.
   Segment 18
      0:01:07.580000 ---> 0:01:11.180000
      It's the closest that life ever got to just bailing.
   Segment 19
      0:01:11.180000 ---> 0:01:16.140000
      So far from dull, the Paleozoic Era just might be one of the most harrowing chapters
   Segment 20
      0:01:16.140000 ---> 0:01:20.140000
      in the story of life on Earth.
   Segment 21
      0:01:20.140000 ---> 0:01:24.260000
      For the first three and a half billion years or so that life existed on this planet, things
   Segment 22
      0:01:24.260000 ---> 0:01:25.260000
      were simple.
   Segment 23
      0:01:25.260000 ---> 0:01:28.780000
      And all living things were in the oceans and most of them couldn't move on their own.
   Segment 24
      0:01:28.780000 ---> 0:01:34.100000
      So the big complex ecosystems that we know today, with active predators and mobile prey,
   Segment 25
      0:01:34.100000 ---> 0:01:35.820000
      didn't really exist.
   Segment 26
      0:01:35.820000 ---> 0:01:38.420000
      Pretty much whatever drifted by you was what you ate.
   Segment 27
      0:01:38.420000 ---> 0:01:43.580000
      That is until about 541 million years ago, when the Paleozoic Era began with a period
   Segment 28
      0:01:43.580000 ---> 0:01:44.940000
      known as the Cambrian.
   Segment 29
      0:01:44.940000 ---> 0:01:47.340000
      And right from the start, things were dramatic.
   Segment 30
      0:01:47.340000 ---> 0:01:52.220000
      This burst of evolutionary innovation, which you know as the Cambrian explosion, was likely
   Segment 31
      0:01:52.220000 ---> 0:01:55.220000
      the result of a whole bunch of environmental triggers.
   Segment 32
      0:01:55.220000 ---> 0:01:59.940000
      In the early Cambrian, thanks to a boom among phytoplankton in the oceans, oxygen levels
   Segment 33
      0:01:59.940000 ---> 0:02:02.620000
      suddenly ramped up, allowing life to flourish.
   Segment 34
      0:02:02.620000 ---> 0:02:06.820000
      Meanwhile, changes in the chemistry of the oceans, brought on by erosion, allowed animals
   Segment 35
      0:02:06.820000 ---> 0:02:09.980000
      to develop things like shells and exoskeletons.
   Segment 36
      0:02:09.980000 ---> 0:02:14.300000
      And this led to the formation of new body plans that the world had never seen before.
   Segment 37
      0:02:14.300000 ---> 0:02:18.780000
      Almost every major group of animals that exist today developed within the first 40 million
   Segment 38
      0:02:18.780000 ---> 0:02:23.780000
      years of the Cambrian, along with many game-changing adaptations, like calcified hard
   Segment 39
      0:02:23.780000 ---> 0:02:26.660000
      parts, flexible limbs, and the very first eyes.
   Segment 40
      0:02:26.660000 ---> 0:02:32.020000
      For instance, the first large predatory organisms appeared, like anomalicaris, which hunted worms
   Segment 41
      0:02:32.020000 ---> 0:02:33.620000
      and other soft-bodied creatures.
   Segment 42
      0:02:33.620000 ---> 0:02:38.780000
      And over time, some animals like arthropods developed hard exoskeletons to protect themselves.
   Segment 43
      0:02:38.780000 ---> 0:02:42.940000
      But others like Pecaya and Hycoella went in a different direction.
   Segment 44
      0:02:42.940000 ---> 0:02:47.420000
      They developed the ability to swim, under their own power, with a flexible rod of cartilage
   Segment 45
      0:02:47.420000 ---> 0:02:49.140000
      to power their tail.
   Segment 46
      0:02:49.140000 ---> 0:02:52.500000
      These ancient swimmers would become the ancestors of the vertebrates.
   Segment 47
      0:02:52.580000 ---> 0:02:57.100000
      The nature breakthroughs like these resulted in whole new, fantastic ecosystems with complex
   Segment 48
      0:02:57.100000 ---> 0:03:00.340000
      food webs that life had not experienced before.
   Segment 49
      0:03:00.340000 ---> 0:03:02.900000
      But this explosion of life couldn't last forever.
   Segment 50
      0:03:02.900000 ---> 0:03:07.780000
      The Cambrian ended 488 million years ago in a mysterious mass extinction that saw the
   Segment 51
      0:03:07.780000 ---> 0:03:10.700000
      disappearance of many trilobite and mollusks species.
   Segment 52
      0:03:10.700000 ---> 0:03:14.820000
      While this extinction is not well understood, a sudden crash in oxygen levels may have been
   Segment 53
      0:03:14.820000 ---> 0:03:15.820000
      to blame.
   Segment 54
      0:03:15.820000 ---> 0:03:19.780000
      And remember that, because a lot of the pivotal events in the Paleozoic will hinge on the
   Segment 55
      0:03:19.780000 ---> 0:03:22.940000
      amount of oxygen, either in the oceans or in the atmosphere.
   Segment 56
      0:03:22.940000 ---> 0:03:27.620000
      But the next period, the Ordovician, bounced back with another burst in diversity.
   Segment 57
      0:03:27.620000 ---> 0:03:32.340000
      This one is known as the Great Ordovician Biodeversification Event, or GOBE.
   Segment 58
      0:03:32.340000 ---> 0:03:37.300000
      You can think of the GOBE as kind of the sequel to the Cambrian Explosion, a sequel that was
   Segment 59
      0:03:37.300000 ---> 0:03:39.540000
      every bit as impressive as the original.
   Segment 60
      0:03:39.540000 ---> 0:03:44.100000
      Like the Cambrian Event, the GOBE was brought on by a host of changes in the environment.
   Segment 61
      0:03:44.100000 ---> 0:03:49.380000
      For one thing, a burst of geological activity about 470 million years ago meant that the
   Segment 62
      0:03:49.380000 ---> 0:03:53.940000
      continents were on the move, creating new chains of islands, and with them new isolated
   Segment 63
      0:03:53.940000 ---> 0:03:54.940000
      habitats.
   Segment 64
      0:03:54.940000 ---> 0:03:59.900000
      And this, combined with changes in sea level and another boost of oxygen in the oceans,
   Segment 65
      0:03:59.900000 ---> 0:04:01.860000
      stimulated a lot of rapid change.
   Segment 66
      0:04:01.860000 ---> 0:04:06.060000
      For example, this is when the first true fish appear on the scene, a straker derms, which
   Segment 67
      0:04:06.060000 ---> 0:04:08.300000
      were jollus-encovered in bony plates.
   Segment 68
      0:04:08.300000 ---> 0:04:12.820000
      Meanwhile, cephalpods reached new links, like the Shell Giant Camarasaris, which grew up
   Segment 69
      0:04:12.820000 ---> 0:04:14.380000
      to 6 meters long.
   Segment 70
      0:04:14.380000 ---> 0:04:18.860000
      But while all this was going on in the water, things on land were truly revolutionary.
   Segment 71
      0:04:18.860000 ---> 0:04:22.940000
      Before the Ordovician, terrestrial life was probably limited to microbes, but early
   Segment 72
      0:04:22.940000 ---> 0:04:27.500000
      in the GOBE, the very first land plants sprouted in the primordial rocks.
   Segment 73
      0:04:27.500000 ---> 0:04:31.740000
      Based on their fossilized spores, we know these plants were small, like modern mosses,
   Segment 74
      0:04:31.740000 ---> 0:04:35.620000
      and if anything, this early greenery might have been too successful.
   Segment 75
      0:04:35.620000 ---> 0:04:39.900000
      The massive number of plants on land took in so much carbon dioxide that the Earth's
   Segment 76
      0:04:39.900000 ---> 0:04:42.980000
      temperature plummeted, and boom, ice age.
   Segment 77
      0:04:42.980000 ---> 0:04:48.300000
      This cold snap occurred 444 million years ago, just as marine oxygen levels started to
   Segment 78
      0:04:48.300000 ---> 0:04:49.300000
      drop.
   Segment 79
      0:04:49.300000 ---> 0:04:53.100000
      And this combination caused the most devastating mass extinction that animal life had faced
   Segment 80
      0:04:53.100000 ---> 0:04:54.100000
      so far.
   Segment 81
      0:04:54.100000 ---> 0:04:59.460000
      The Ordovician-Solarian extinction event wiped out 86% of marine species, including many
   Segment 82
      0:04:59.460000 ---> 0:05:01.500000
      kinds of trilobites and cephalpods.
   Segment 83
      0:05:01.500000 ---> 0:05:05.020000
      As you can tell from the name, it brought an end to the Ordovician and marked the beginning
   Segment 84
      0:05:05.020000 ---> 0:05:07.300000
      of the next period, the Solerian.
   Segment 85
      0:05:07.300000 ---> 0:05:11.820000
      Life was able to recover once again in the Solerian, this time as the climate gradually
   Segment 86
      0:05:11.820000 ---> 0:05:12.820000
      warmed.
   Segment 87
      0:05:12.820000 ---> 0:05:14.780000
      Plants, for example, started to spread over the land.
   Segment 88
      0:05:14.860000 ---> 0:05:20.260000
      Fossils of early vascular plants like Cucsonia first appear in rocks from this period, as
   Segment 89
      0:05:20.260000 ---> 0:05:22.540000
      do the first fossils of terrestrial fungi.
   Segment 90
      0:05:22.540000 ---> 0:05:26.780000
      The Jollis-Austracadyrms were still the most common swimmers in the sea, and they developed
   Segment 91
      0:05:26.780000 ---> 0:05:31.980000
      all sorts of spines and horns, likely to protect themselves from carnivorous sea scorpions,
   Segment 92
      0:05:31.980000 ---> 0:05:32.980000
      the Eurypterids.
   Segment 93
      0:05:32.980000 ---> 0:05:37.740000
      But by the end of the Solerian 419 million years ago, a new type of fish learned to bite
   Segment 94
      0:05:37.740000 ---> 0:05:38.740000
      back.
   Segment 95
      0:05:38.740000 ---> 0:05:43.220000
      Johnfish, like Intellidnathus, appeared in the seas, equipped with biting power that
   Segment 96
      0:05:43.220000 ---> 0:05:46.860000
      allowed them to tackle prey that the Jollisfish couldn't handle.
   Segment 97
      0:05:46.860000 ---> 0:05:51.980000
      And the Solerian drew to a close with its own relatively minor series of extinction events,
   Segment 98
      0:05:51.980000 ---> 0:05:56.460000
      likely brought about by the drops in sea level that caused many bottom-dwelling species,
   Segment 99
      0:05:56.460000 ---> 0:05:58.780000
      particularly cephalpods, to die out.
   Segment 100
      0:05:58.780000 ---> 0:06:03.700000
      The period that followed the Devonian was when fish began their takeover of the seas.
   Segment 101
      0:06:03.700000 ---> 0:06:07.500000
      During this time, the earliest sharks make their appearance, but the true kings of the
   Segment 102
      0:06:07.500000 ---> 0:06:10.660000
      Devonian were another kind of fish, the Placoderms.
   Segment 103
      0:06:10.660000 ---> 0:06:14.980000
      The largest of these jawed, armored fish filled the niches we associate with whales
   Segment 104
      0:06:14.980000 ---> 0:06:20.100000
      and sharks today, including filter feeders like Titanicses and the apex predators like
   Segment 105
      0:06:20.100000 ---> 0:06:21.540000
      Dunkleostius.
   Segment 106
      0:06:21.540000 ---> 0:06:26.420000
      While the Placoderms were conquering the seas, things were getting even more crowded on land.
   Segment 107
      0:06:26.420000 ---> 0:06:30.940000
      Arthropods really started to diversify, with the first insects and terrestrial arachnids
   Segment 108
      0:06:30.940000 ---> 0:06:31.940000
      emerging.
   Segment 109
      0:06:31.940000 ---> 0:06:37.580000
      Trees also arose at this time, forming a canopy above the arthropods, and these Devonian forests
   Segment 110
      0:06:37.580000 ---> 0:06:40.620000
      became the first major terrestrial ecosystems on Earth.
   Segment 111
      0:06:40.620000 ---> 0:06:45.260000
      Meanwhile, back at the water's edge, relatives of Loafen fish had adapted to spend more time
   Segment 112
      0:06:45.260000 ---> 0:06:48.620000
      in the shallows, pulling themselves along muddy shorelines.
   Segment 113
      0:06:48.620000 ---> 0:06:53.100000
      Then, 397 million years ago, descendants of these critters finally hauled themselves
   Segment 114
      0:06:53.100000 ---> 0:06:54.660000
      on land for the first time.
   Segment 115
      0:06:54.660000 ---> 0:06:59.060000
      No skeletons of these ancient pioneers are known, but footprints in Poland show evidence
   Segment 116
      0:06:59.060000 ---> 0:07:02.060000
      of these very first tetrapods, animals with four limbs.
   Segment 117
      0:07:02.060000 ---> 0:07:06.940000
      By the late Devonian 365 million years ago, tetrapods had made their way across the entire
   Segment 118
      0:07:06.940000 ---> 0:07:11.340000
      globe, from a camphosega in Greenland to this dude in Russia.
   Segment 119
      0:07:11.340000 ---> 0:07:15.820000
      So the Devonian produced the first complex land ecosystems, while also seeing vertebrates
   Segment 120
      0:07:15.820000 ---> 0:07:18.540000
      take center stage in the oceans for the first time.
   Segment 121
      0:07:18.540000 ---> 0:07:22.860000
      But the period ended and, you guessed it, another mass extinction.
   Segment 122
      0:07:22.860000 ---> 0:07:29.820000
      This one took place from 375 to 358 million years ago, and came in at least two phases.
   Segment 123
      0:07:29.820000 ---> 0:07:33.940000
      Together these events are known as the late Devonian Extinctions, and they seem to have
   Segment 124
      0:07:33.940000 ---> 0:07:37.460000
      been caused by a series of drops in oxygen levels in the seas.
   Segment 125
      0:07:37.460000 ---> 0:07:41.740000
      By the end of the Devonian, many trilobites and all of the armored placoderms had vanished
   Segment 126
      0:07:41.740000 ---> 0:07:43.180000
      from the world's oceans.
   Segment 127
      0:07:43.180000 ---> 0:07:47.460000
      Luckily for us and other land animals, at least some early tetrapods survived into the
   Segment 128
      0:07:47.460000 ---> 0:07:49.660000
      next period, the Carboniferous.
   Segment 129
      0:07:49.660000 ---> 0:07:52.660000
      But these creatures lived in a very different world from the Devonian.
   Segment 130
      0:07:52.660000 ---> 0:07:57.900000
      This time, oxygen in the atmosphere ramped up, and this, along with a humid, warm climate,
   Segment 131
      0:07:57.900000 ---> 0:08:01.300000
      allowed dense forests and swamps to spread across the continents.
   Segment 132
      0:08:01.300000 ---> 0:08:06.420000
      All that oxygen was also a plus for the arthropods, which got huge in the Carboniferous,
   Segment 133
      0:08:06.420000 ---> 0:08:09.700000
      but the bigger news was a major change among the tetrapods.
   Segment 134
      0:08:09.700000 ---> 0:08:14.820000
      Previously, all tetrapods laid their eggs in water, but around 340 million years ago,
   Segment 135
      0:08:14.820000 ---> 0:08:19.500000
      a group of tetrapods called amniotes began laying their eggs with shells that protected
   Segment 136
      0:08:19.500000 ---> 0:08:20.820000
      them from drying out.
   Segment 137
      0:08:20.820000 ---> 0:08:26.340000
      And this turned out to be a crucial adaptation, because it was around this time that the continents
   Segment 138
      0:08:26.340000 ---> 0:08:29.060000
      began to merge into a single super-continent.
   Segment 139
      0:08:29.060000 ---> 0:08:32.140000
      Eventually, over millions of years, it would become pangaea.
   Segment 140
      0:08:32.140000 ---> 0:08:37.220000
      This landmass was so big that it was impossible for moisture from the ocean to reach inland.
   Segment 141
      0:08:37.220000 ---> 0:08:38.220000
      The result?
   Segment 142
      0:08:38.220000 ---> 0:08:42.220000
      A severe drop in humidity and temperature that wiped out much of the Carboniferous forest
   Segment 143
      0:08:42.220000 ---> 0:08:44.060000
      about 305 million years ago.
   Segment 144
      0:08:44.060000 ---> 0:08:47.300000
      It's known today as the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse.
   Segment 145
      0:08:47.300000 ---> 0:08:51.740000
      By the end of this period, about 290 million years ago, much of the forests were replaced
   Segment 146
      0:08:51.740000 ---> 0:08:57.380000
      by a giant desert at the heart of the continent, with extensive glaciers in the southern hemisphere.
   Segment 147
      0:08:57.380000 ---> 0:09:03.380000
      These arid wastelands would have been uninhabitable for early tetrapods, but not for the amniotes,
   Segment 148
      0:09:03.380000 ---> 0:09:07.940000
      and they rapidly split into two major groups, the reptiles and the synapses.
   Segment 149
      0:09:07.940000 ---> 0:09:12.260000
      And both groups spent the last period of the Paleozoic, the Permian, spreading across
   Segment 150
      0:09:12.260000 ---> 0:09:13.260000
      pangaea.
   Segment 151
      0:09:13.260000 ---> 0:09:18.020000
      The synapses were actually stem mammals, and they were survivors, producing the first
   Segment 152
      0:09:18.020000 ---> 0:09:20.700000
      large terrestrial herbivores like Dimetradon.
   Segment 153
      0:09:20.700000 ---> 0:09:24.100000
      But as the Permian went on, the climate got hotter and drier.
   Segment 154
      0:09:24.100000 ---> 0:09:28.300000
      Some mammals and reptiles alike were forced to adapt to even harsher conditions.
   Segment 155
      0:09:28.300000 ---> 0:09:32.020000
      On the reptile side, there were cattle-sized herbivores, like pariosaur.
   Segment 156
      0:09:32.020000 ---> 0:09:36.260000
      Meanwhile, stem mammals grew even stranger, with the saber-toothed gorgonopsids hunting
   Segment 157
      0:09:36.260000 ---> 0:09:40.820000
      hippo-like omnivores with weird head ornaments, like a stimino sukis.
   Segment 158
      0:09:40.820000 ---> 0:09:46.300000
      But this Permian safari part came to a terrifying end 252 million years ago.
   Segment 159
      0:09:46.300000 ---> 0:09:50.620000
      It was probably caused by a combination of volcanic activity and climate change, but
   Segment 160
      0:09:50.620000 ---> 0:09:55.420000
      the result, the Permian Triassic extinction event, nearly spelled doom for life on Earth.
   Segment 161
      0:09:55.420000 ---> 0:10:01.180000
      96% of marine species, including many sharks, fish, and all the trilobites were wiped out.
   Segment 162
      0:10:01.180000 ---> 0:10:06.300000
      On land, the stem mammals and the reptiles suffered as well, with a 70% loss of terrestrial
   Segment 163
      0:10:06.300000 ---> 0:10:07.300000
      species.
   Segment 164
      0:10:07.300000 ---> 0:10:11.660000
      So it began with an explosion of life, but the Paleozoic ended in near-apocalypse.
   Segment 165
      0:10:11.660000 ---> 0:10:16.260000
      And while life started out in this era, a simple small marine organism spied its end,
   Segment 166
      0:10:16.260000 ---> 0:10:20.060000
      life had conquered the oceans, taken the very first steps on land, and spread to the
   Segment 167
      0:10:20.060000 ---> 0:10:22.660000
      most inhospitable corners of our planet.
   Segment 168
      0:10:22.660000 ---> 0:10:28.300000
      So yes, it was not exactly a heyday of charismatic megafauna, but it's no overstatement to say
   Segment 169
      0:10:28.300000 ---> 0:10:33.100000
      that the Paleozoic era made life what it is today.
   Segment 170

   Segment 176
      0:10:57.940000 ---> 0:11:01.780000
      Sometimes science writing can get a little heady, and Bryson does a wonderful job at
   Segment 177

   Segment 189
      0:11:44.140000 ---> 0:11:45.740000
      microfauna, the Tardigrades.

Transcription for How Cyanobacteria Took Over The World.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:16.800000
      Sianobacteria have a deceiving sense of the understated about them.
   Segment 2
      0:00:16.800000 ---> 0:00:21.720000
      Compared to some of the complex organisms we've featured on Journey to the Microcosmos,
   Segment 3
      0:00:21.720000 ---> 0:00:28.640000
      these blue-green bacteria seem almost basic in their morphology and habits.
   Segment 4
      0:00:28.640000 ---> 0:00:35.240000
      They glide, divide, and photosynthesize.
   Segment 5
      0:00:35.240000 ---> 0:00:38.560000
      Oh, and they get eaten a bunch too.
   Segment 6
      0:00:38.560000 ---> 0:00:42.480000
      But you do not need to be complicated to be important.
   Segment 7
      0:00:42.480000 ---> 0:00:47.240000
      Ecosystems are built on primary producers like cyanobacteria.
   Segment 8
      0:00:47.240000 ---> 0:00:55.080000
      The energy they translate from the sun into chemical stores gets past up the food chain,
   Segment 9
      0:00:55.080000 ---> 0:01:00.360000
      sustaining life of all sizes.
   Segment 10
      0:01:00.360000 ---> 0:01:07.120000
      And long ago, some eukaryotes gained their own photosynthetic abilities by absorbing
   Segment 11
      0:01:07.120000 ---> 0:01:15.520000
      cyanobacteria, an endosymbiotic event that set the stage for the evolution of plants.
   Segment 12
      0:01:15.520000 ---> 0:01:18.960000
      And plants are a pretty big deal.
   Segment 13
      0:01:18.960000 ---> 0:01:25.720000
      Microbacteria, however, are more than just a prologue for the story of complex life forms.
   Segment 14
      0:01:25.720000 ---> 0:01:31.960000
      You might say, they are the creative forces behind that tail.
   Segment 15
      0:01:31.960000 ---> 0:01:38.480000
      Billions of years ago, these tiny, seemingly innocuous organisms brought something new
   Segment 16
      0:01:38.480000 ---> 0:01:39.880000
      to the planet.
   Segment 17
      0:01:39.880000 ---> 0:01:47.880000
      An innovation that would create massive changes in their environment and set the stage for
   Segment 18
      0:01:47.880000 ---> 0:01:52.520000
      eons of remarkable life to come.
   Segment 19
      0:01:52.520000 ---> 0:01:58.080000
      This is the story of the great oxidation event.
   Segment 20
      0:01:58.080000 ---> 0:02:06.080000
      And how, in the process of destroying the world as it existed, cyanobacteria created
   Segment 21
      0:02:06.080000 ---> 0:02:14.040000
      the Earth as we know it now.
   Segment 22
      0:02:14.040000 ---> 0:02:21.400000
      The bulk of this tail takes place about 2.5 billion years ago at the end of the Arcean
   Segment 23
      0:02:21.400000 ---> 0:02:27.320000
      eon that had started about 1.5 billion years before.
   Segment 24
      0:02:27.320000 ---> 0:02:34.840000
      This vast stretch of time included huge milestones for our planet, including the early days of
   Segment 25
      0:02:34.840000 ---> 0:02:36.680000
      the microcosmos.
   Segment 26
      0:02:36.680000 ---> 0:02:41.040000
      But the Arcean Earth looked very different from ours.
   Segment 27
      0:02:41.040000 ---> 0:02:47.960000
      The planet's crust was stabilizing and the oceans were filled with dissolved iron.
   Segment 28
      0:02:47.960000 ---> 0:02:55.920000
      Most importantly though, the world was anoxic, meaning it had almost no oxygen.
   Segment 29
      0:02:55.920000 ---> 0:03:02.600000
      And because life reflects the environment it fills, the earliest creatures on our planet
   Segment 30
      0:03:02.600000 ---> 0:03:05.200000
      were anaerobic microorganisms.
   Segment 31
      0:03:05.200000 ---> 0:03:11.200000
      Built to withstand and thrive in an oxygenless environment.
   Segment 32
      0:03:11.200000 ---> 0:03:17
      Some of these organisms may have been phototrophic, but their photosynthetic machinery relied
   Segment 33
      0:03:17 ---> 0:03:25.520000
      on iron and sulphide in place of water, similar to bacteria like phyosperyllum that thrive
   Segment 34
      0:03:25.520000 ---> 0:03:28.720000
      in anoxic conditions today.
   Segment 35
      0:03:28.720000 ---> 0:03:34.720000
      But for all of the dramatic changes in Earth and in life that took place during the Arcean
   Segment 36
      0:03:34.720000 ---> 0:03:42.640000
      eon, the real transformation was only just beginning.
   Segment 37
      0:03:42.640000 ---> 0:03:50.800000
      We don't know quite when cyanobacteria emerged, just that it's sometime before 2.5 billion
   Segment 38
      0:03:50.800000 ---> 0:03:52.320000
      years ago.
   Segment 39
      0:03:52.320000 ---> 0:03:58.560000
      And when they did, cyanobacteria brought something new to the photosynthetic mix.
   Segment 40
      0:03:58.560000 ---> 0:04:05.600000
      They used light to split water into its chemical components, hydrogen, which could then be
   Segment 41
      0:04:05.600000 ---> 0:04:13.600000
      used to make other energy storing compounds, and oxygen, which was released into the environment
   Segment 42
      0:04:13.600000 ---> 0:04:15.800000
      as a waste product.
   Segment 43
      0:04:15.800000 ---> 0:04:22.040000
      This simple chemical reaction is the source of the great oxidation event, which you might
   Segment 44
      0:04:22.040000 ---> 0:04:29.080000
      also hear called the great oxygenation event, an accumulation of oxygen in a previously
   Segment 45
      0:04:29.080000 ---> 0:04:31.200000
      anoxic world.
   Segment 46
      0:04:31.200000 ---> 0:04:37.840000
      That reaction would go on to become one of the most important ones to life, the source
   Segment 47
      0:04:37.840000 ---> 0:04:42.320000
      of the very oxygen you are breathing now.
   Segment 48
      0:04:42.320000 ---> 0:04:50.320000
      And remarkably, cyanobacteria were not just the first organisms to evolve oxygenic photosynthesis.
   Segment 49
      0:04:50.320000 ---> 0:04:57.680000
      As far as we know, on our planet anyway, they are the only organisms that do so.
   Segment 50
      0:04:57.680000 ---> 0:05:03.640000
      Other photosynthetic bacteria don't produce oxygen, and the eukaryotic organisms that
   Segment 51
      0:05:03.640000 ---> 0:05:11.020000
      gained the capacity for photosynthesis did so by co-opting the talons and machinery of
   Segment 52
      0:05:11.020000 ---> 0:05:15.040000
      endosambiotic cyanobacteria.
   Segment 53
      0:05:15.040000 ---> 0:05:17.960000
      It is wonderful as that is now.
   Segment 54
      0:05:17.960000 ---> 0:05:24.200000
      Back at the end of the Archean Eon, oxygenic photosynthesis didn't just make cyanobacteria
   Segment 55
      0:05:24.200000 ---> 0:05:28.960000
      unique, it made them catastrophic.
   Segment 56
      0:05:28.960000 ---> 0:05:34.800000
      Oxygen is great if you are evolved to tolerate it and to use it.
   Segment 57
      0:05:34.800000 ---> 0:05:41.280000
      But for the anaerobic microorganisms specifically evolved for a world without oxygen, this new
   Segment 58
      0:05:41.280000 ---> 0:05:44.880000
      fangled molecule was toxic.
   Segment 59
      0:05:44.880000 ---> 0:05:51.600000
      The species that survived the Great Oxidation event likely did so by finding oxygen-less
   Segment 60
      0:05:51.600000 ---> 0:05:54.320000
      sanctuaries.
   Segment 61
      0:05:54.320000 ---> 0:05:59.800000
      And meanwhile, cyanobacteria continued pumping out oxygen.
   Segment 62
      0:05:59.800000 ---> 0:06:06.160000
      Yes, they are tiny, and the amount of gas they produce is even tinier, but with hundreds
   Segment 63
      0:06:06.160000 ---> 0:06:13.880000
      of millions of years, and many, many organisms, all of those reactions added up, affecting
   Segment 64
      0:06:13.880000 ---> 0:06:20.200000
      not only the lives of their fellow microbes, but also the chemistry and climate of the
   Segment 65
      0:06:20.200000 ---> 0:06:21.960000
      entire planet.
   Segment 66
      0:06:21.960000 ---> 0:06:28.880000
      For one, cyanobacteria might be responsible for setting off a series of ice ages.
   Segment 67
      0:06:28.880000 ---> 0:06:34.220000
      As they consumed carbon dioxide and produced oxygen that reacted with methane, they cut
   Segment 68
      0:06:34.220000 ---> 0:06:39.520000
      down on the planet's stock of greenhouse gases and dropped temperatures to glacial
   Segment 69
      0:06:39.520000 ---> 0:06:40.520000
      levels.
   Segment 70
      0:06:40.520000 ---> 0:06:47.060000
      As you might imagine, these early ice ages were not particularly hospitable for life,
   Segment 71
      0:06:47.060000 ---> 0:06:49.740000
      including for cyanobacteria.
   Segment 72
      0:06:49.740000 ---> 0:06:54.620000
      Coupled with the anaerobic microbes that died due to all that oxygen in the atmosphere,
   Segment 73
      0:06:54.620000 ---> 0:07:01.060000
      the Great Oxidation event is responsible for an extinction so ancient that we don't have
   Segment 74
      0:07:01.060000 ---> 0:07:10.580000
      the tools or physical evidence to even fully describe it, but life still managed to endure.
   Segment 75
      0:07:10.580000 ---> 0:07:18.420000
      And as it did, the oxygen produced by cyanobacteria would go on to form our planet's ozone layer,
   Segment 76
      0:07:18.420000 ---> 0:07:23.860000
      shielding the survivors from dangerous ultraviolet wavelengths of light.
   Segment 77
      0:07:23.860000 ---> 0:07:30.660000
      Moreover, the availability of oxygen in the water and air would go on to make aerobic metabolism
   Segment 78
      0:07:30.660000 ---> 0:07:37.620000
      possible, providing organisms more energy than anaerobic metabolism ever could, and
   Segment 79
      0:07:37.620000 ---> 0:07:42.100000
      thus the capacity for more complex life.
   Segment 80
      0:07:42.100000 ---> 0:07:48.580000
      This intertwined story of destruction and evolution is built on evidence scientists
   Segment 81
      0:07:48.580000 ---> 0:07:52.820000
      have gathered from geological and biological sources.
   Segment 82
      0:07:52.820000 ---> 0:08:00.380000
      Some parts are etched in rocks like the banded iron formations formed by oxygen reacting
   Segment 83
      0:08:00.380000 ---> 0:08:08.460000
      with iron in the ocean, and other parts are encoded in the genes of modern day cyanobacteria
   Segment 84
      0:08:08.460000 ---> 0:08:21.180000
      whose sequences and machinery elucidate what their ancient counterparts may have looked like.
   Segment 85
      0:08:21.180000 ---> 0:08:27.580000
      But characterizing the lives of microbes that existed billions and billions of years ago
   Segment 86
      0:08:27.580000 ---> 0:08:34.540000
      is really, really hard, especially because we haven't uncovered many archaeum fossils.
   Segment 87
      0:08:34.540000 ---> 0:08:38.700000
      One recent paper begins with the following confession.
   Segment 88
      0:08:38.700000 ---> 0:08:49.420000
      Writing about early microbial evolution is a daunting task, so it was possibly unwise to agree to do it.
   Segment 89
      0:08:49.420000 ---> 0:08:56.540000
      And as you dig through the research on the subject, that honest evaluation rings true.
   Segment 90
      0:08:56.540000 ---> 0:09:01.340000
      There are many gaps in our understanding of the Great Oxidation event.
   Segment 91
      0:09:01.340000 ---> 0:09:05.900000
      Gaps built on unanswered fundamental questions like,
   Segment 92
      0:09:05.900000 ---> 0:09:10.060000
      how did photosynthesis even evolve?
   Segment 93
      0:09:10.060000 ---> 0:09:13.900000
      We alluded to one of the most important gaps earlier.
   Segment 94
      0:09:13.900000 ---> 0:09:18.620000
      It's the question of when cyanobacteria first appeared,
   Segment 95
      0:09:18.620000 ---> 0:09:24.380000
      and that question is key to understanding how they caused the Great Oxidation event.
   Segment 96
      0:09:24.380000 ---> 0:09:29.260000
      If that event began shortly after the evolution of cyanobacteria and
   Segment 97
      0:09:29.260000 ---> 0:09:33.900000
      oxygenic photosynthesis, then it all seems relatively straightforward.
   Segment 98
      0:09:33.900000 ---> 0:09:40.460000
      The cyanobacteria produced oxygen, the oxygen accumulated, and catastrophe ensued.
   Segment 99
      0:09:40.460000 ---> 0:09:47.180000
      But some evidence suggests that cyanobacteria emerged well before the accumulation of oxygen
   Segment 100
      0:09:47.180000 ---> 0:09:53.740000
      on Earth. And if that's the case, then we have to ask what took so long for the Great Oxidation
   Segment 101
      0:09:53.740000 ---> 0:10:00.620000
      event to begin. Maybe there was a geological delay of some sort, or maybe
   Segment 102
      0:10:00.620000 ---> 0:10:06.220000
      oxygenic photosynthesis wasn't the only cyanobacterial innovation,
   Segment 103
      0:10:06.220000 ---> 0:10:12.540000
      maybe after their first appearances on the planet, that developed some other trait that bumped their
   Segment 104
      0:10:12.540000 ---> 0:10:18.940000
      oxygen production up even more. One group of scientists investigated that very possibility,
   Segment 105
      0:10:18.940000 ---> 0:10:23.740000
      and came to a possible explanation that we don't often associate with bacteria,
   Segment 106
      0:10:24.540000 ---> 0:10:33.340000
      multicellularity. Some modern cyanobacteria species form filaments of individual cells,
   Segment 107
      0:10:33.340000 ---> 0:10:38.460000
      a few of which even take on specialized functions like nitrogen fixation.
   Segment 108
      0:10:39.340000 ---> 0:10:46.300000
      These scientists trace the origins of that trait to before the Great Oxidation event,
   Segment 109
      0:10:46.300000 ---> 0:10:53.980000
      so maybe multicellularity allowed cyanobacteria to not only better contend with the challenges
   Segment 110
      0:10:53.980000 ---> 0:11:01.420000
      of their environment, but to produce more oxygen than before, and perhaps this was the added trait
   Segment 111
      0:11:01.420000 ---> 0:11:11.340000
      needed to say allow a new kind of bacteria to take over an entire world. A claim over our planet
   Segment 112
      0:11:11.340000 ---> 0:11:18.540000
      that they have in many ways never given up. Of course that idea is scientific conjecture
   Segment 113
      0:11:18.540000 ---> 0:11:24.620000
      built on the available evidence, which means it is still subject to debate, but the seemingly
   Segment 114
      0:11:24.620000 ---> 0:11:32.300000
      simple question underlying it. The question of when cyanobacteria evolved reflects what's so
   Segment 115
      0:11:32.300000 ---> 0:11:38.060000
      important about the Great Oxidation event in general, that questions of biology and geology
   Segment 116
      0:11:38.060000 ---> 0:11:43.580000
      and climate are so intertwined that to understand the history of this planet,
   Segment 117
      0:11:44.140000 ---> 0:11:52.300000
      we have to piece together the history of the microcosmos. And if something as small as cyanobacteria
   Segment 118
      0:11:52.300000 ---> 0:12:00.380000
      can set off a catastrophe of extinction and ice, well, then what will the planet look like when we
   Segment 119
      0:12:00.460000 ---> 0:12:01.180000
      are through with it?
   Segment 120
      0:12:05.100000 ---> 0:12:11.260000
      Thank you for coming on this journey with us. As we explore the unseen world, that surrounds us.
   Segment 121
      0:12:11.260000 ---> 0:12:16.220000
      The Stentr-Keruleus pins have been restocked, there's a link in the description so you can check
   Segment 122
      0:12:16.220000 ---> 0:12:21.660000
      that out. Thanks to everybody who's sporting one of their favorite microorganisms on their
   Segment 123
      0:12:21.660000 ---> 0:12:28.300000
      backpacker jacket now, and thank you also to all of these people who make this show possible.
   Segment 124
      0:12:28.300000 ---> 0:12:33.180000
      So if you like what we do, you can thank them for that. What a wonderful group of people
   Segment 125
      0:12:33.180000 ---> 0:12:40.940000
      that allow us to explore these big, weird mysteries of life on this planet. If you want to see more

Transcription for How NASA Plans to Discover Alien Life on Jupiter’s Moon, Europa # Countdown To Launch.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:05.360000
      The search for extraterrestrial life extends into the far reaches of our galaxy, and while
   Segment 2
      0:00:05.360000 ---> 0:00:10.640000
      several distant exoplanets are strong candidates to make me host life, what if the most promising
   Segment 3
      0:00:10.640000 ---> 0:00:16.480000
      destination is right in our celestial backyard? The perfect conditions for alien life might just
   Segment 4
      0:00:16.480000 ---> 0:00:22
      be hidden under the icy crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, and since it's in our solar system,
   Segment 5
      0:00:22 ---> 0:00:27.440000
      we can actually go to it. A new mission from NASA just got the green light to proceed with building
   Segment 6
      0:00:27.760000 ---> 0:00:32.880000
      an in-depth investigative orbiter named Europa Clipper. This will be the first time we send a
   Segment 7
      0:00:32.880000 ---> 0:00:39.440000
      spacecraft to a moon other than our own, and perhaps uncover that we might not be alone in the universe.
   Segment 8
      0:00:39.440000 ---> 0:00:44.160000
      So, NASA has reason to believe that Europa is potentially habitable because of information they
   Segment 9
      0:00:44.160000 ---> 0:00:49.040000
      received from the Hubble Space Telescope and from previous space missions. These spacecraft weren't
   Segment 10
      0:00:49.040000 ---> 0:00:54.080000
      destined for Europa, but they took measurements of the moon's surface while passing by. It was
   Segment 11
      0:00:54.160000 ---> 0:00:59.600000
      one of these flybys that the strongest piece of evidence of Europa's ocean emerged. The Galileo
   Segment 12
      0:00:59.600000 ---> 0:01:04.400000
      mission measured a deep magnetic field that could only be produced by an electrically conductive
   Segment 13
      0:01:04.400000 ---> 0:01:10.880000
      fluid under the moon's 15-25-kilometre thick icy layer. Scientists estimate even though the moon is
   Segment 14
      0:01:10.880000 ---> 0:01:16.960000
      10% smaller than our own, the predicted saltwater ocean underneath could be twice the volume of
   Segment 15
      0:01:16.960000 ---> 0:01:22
      all of Earth's oceans combined. Now, life as we know it needs at least three requirements.
   Segment 16
      0:01:22 ---> 0:01:27.120000
      Liquid water, the right chemical elements, and an energy source. So, while this icy world
   Segment 17
      0:01:27.120000 ---> 0:01:32.960000
      probably has water and possible elements, it's been hard to nail down an energy source on Europa,
   Segment 18
      0:01:32.960000 ---> 0:01:37.840000
      but NASA's orbiter is prepared to find it. The Europa Clipper's payload will be stocked with
   Segment 19
      0:01:37.840000 ---> 0:01:43.040000
      nine different instruments, each built by researchers across the US and curated by NASA specifically
   Segment 20
      0:01:43.040000 ---> 0:01:48.320000
      for this mission. Some of the equipment are systems like cameras and spectrometers that aim to map
   Segment 21
      0:01:48.320000 ---> 0:01:53.280000
      and produce high-resolution images, but other specialized machinery includes a dual-frequency
   Segment 22
      0:01:53.280000 ---> 0:01:58.800000
      radar instrument that can penetrate the thickness of Europa's icy shell in search for subsurface
   Segment 23
      0:01:58.800000 ---> 0:02:04.400000
      lakes, like the ones found in Antarctica. There will also be a magnetometer device and a plasma
   Segment 24
      0:02:04.400000 ---> 0:02:09.760000
      instrument that together will measure Europa's magnetic field and the ocean's depth and salinity.
   Segment 25
      0:02:09.760000 ---> 0:02:14.720000
      And even more tools will be searching for water plumes erupting from the moon's surface,
   Segment 26
      0:02:14.720000 ---> 0:02:19.280000
      and will be able to detect even tiny water particles in the atmosphere. These droplets
   Segment 27
      0:02:19.280000 ---> 0:02:24.960000
      might be connected to the hidden subsurface ocean. Every instrument on board is designed to paint
   Segment 28
      0:02:24.960000 ---> 0:02:30.160000
      a detailed picture of the moon's composition from the surface to the atmosphere, without ever
   Segment 29
      0:02:30.160000 ---> 0:02:36.640000
      actually landing on it. In fact, the spacecraft won't be orbiting Europa at all. The moon sits
   Segment 30
      0:02:36.640000 ---> 0:02:42.080000
      within one of Jupiter's intense bands of radiation, and although Clipper is armed to withstand some
   Segment 31
      0:02:42.160000 ---> 0:02:47.440000
      radioactive emissions, it wouldn't last more than a few weeks around Europa. Instead, the
   Segment 32
      0:02:47.440000 ---> 0:02:53.920000
      orbiter will be using Jupiter's gravitational pull to loop around Europa on 45 close flybys,
   Segment 33
      0:02:53.920000 ---> 0:03:00.400000
      some as close as 25 kilometers. Now, just to be clear, at the very least, if scientists do find
   Segment 34
      0:03:00.400000 ---> 0:03:06.080000
      life, they are expecting it to most likely be in the form of tiny microbes, maybe similar to the
   Segment 35
      0:03:06.080000 ---> 0:03:11.280000
      extremophile creatures we have on Earth that thrive in places like subterranean volcanoes,
   Segment 36
      0:03:11.280000 ---> 0:03:17.360000
      deep sea vents, or arid deserts. There could be something more complex to find, but at the moment,
   Segment 37
      0:03:17.360000 ---> 0:03:21.920000
      there's a bigger hurdle still facing this mission. How will it get there?
   Segment 38
      0:03:21.920000 ---> 0:03:28.320000
      According to NASA, the Europa Clipper remains on target for a launch between 2023 and 2025.
   Segment 39
      0:03:28.320000 ---> 0:03:32.480000
      The question is whether it will fly on NASA's Space Launch System rocket,
   Segment 40
      0:03:32.480000 ---> 0:03:37.040000
      which may not be ready in the next few years, or if it'll ride atop a commercial rocket,
   Segment 41
      0:03:37.040000 ---> 0:03:42.960000
      like SpaceX's Falcon Heavy or United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy. But commercial options lead to
   Segment 42
      0:03:42.960000 ---> 0:03:48.480000
      more travel time in space, which Clipper might not be ready for. Timelines aren't matching up,
   Segment 43
      0:03:48.480000 ---> 0:03:53.520000
      and the politics are still murky for this pivotal mission, which makes the anticipation
   Segment 44
      0:03:53.520000 ---> 0:03:59.440000
      all the more nail biting. Because of the challenges of distance and radiation paired with the enormously
   Segment 45
      0:03:59.520000 ---> 0:04:05.040000
      tantalizing idea of finding life beyond Earth, Europa Clipper is maybe one of the most ambitious
   Segment 46
      0:04:05.040000 ---> 0:04:09.840000
      missions ever attempted by NASA. We still have some years before anything is leaving the ground,
   Segment 47
      0:04:09.840000 ---> 0:04:14.800000
      but we'll be keeping a watchful eye on this mission that could change our perspective of life in the
   Segment 48
      0:04:14.800000 ---> 0:04:21.040000
      universe forever. Europa Clipper is exciting, so exciting in fact that people are pushing to send
   Segment 49
      0:04:21.040000 ---> 0:04:26.320000
      a lander next, but we'll have to get there first. If you want more launch updates in your day,

Transcription for Jupiter's Moons# Crash Course Astronomy #17.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:06.560000
      This episode of Crash Course is brought to you by Squarespace.
   Segment 2
      0:00:06.560000 ---> 0:00:11.160000
      As we saw in the last episode, Jupiter is by far the largest and most massive planet
   Segment 3
      0:00:11.160000 ---> 0:00:12.720000
      in the solar system.
   Segment 4
      0:00:12.720000 ---> 0:00:17.400000
      That means it has a very strong gravitational field, which also means it can hold on to
   Segment 5
      0:00:17.400000 ---> 0:00:18.400000
      a lot of moons.
   Segment 6
      0:00:18.400000 ---> 0:00:19.400000
      A lot!
   Segment 7
      0:00:19.400000 ---> 0:00:23.600000
      Right now as we record this episode, there are 67 that have been confirmed.
   Segment 8
      0:00:23.600000 ---> 0:00:25.280000
      And how many it really has?
   Segment 9
      0:00:25.280000 ---> 0:00:38.400000
      It depends on how small an object you're willing to call a moon.
   Segment 10
      0:00:38.400000 ---> 0:00:43.040000
      In 1610, Galileo pointed his telescope at Jupiter and witnessed a revolution.
   Segment 11
      0:00:43.040000 ---> 0:00:44.280000
      Oh hey, literally!
   Segment 12
      0:00:44.280000 ---> 0:00:47.920000
      He saw three little stars lined up on either side of Jupiter.
   Segment 13
      0:00:47.920000 ---> 0:00:50.520000
      Stars he could not see with his naked eye, and they moved.
   Segment 14
      0:00:50.520000 ---> 0:00:55.520000
      A week later he saw a fourth one, and he knew he was seeing objects revolving, orbiting
   Segment 15
      0:00:55.520000 ---> 0:00:56.520000
      around Jupiter.
   Segment 16
      0:00:56.520000 ---> 0:01:00.160000
      It was proof that not everything in the solar system revolved around the Earth.
   Segment 17
      0:01:00.160000 ---> 0:01:01.280000
      That was a pretty big deal.
   Segment 18
      0:01:01.280000 ---> 0:01:05.360000
      Those four moons are now called the Galilean Moons in his honor.
   Segment 19
      0:01:05.360000 ---> 0:01:06.480000
      Not bad for a week's work.
   Segment 20
      0:01:06.480000 ---> 0:01:08.440000
      All four are really big too.
   Segment 21
      0:01:08.440000 ---> 0:01:11.760000
      If Jupiter weren't there drowning them out with its glare, they'd be visible to the
   Segment 22
      0:01:11.760000 ---> 0:01:12.760000
      naked eye.
   Segment 23
      0:01:12.760000 ---> 0:01:15.080000
      In that case, we might even call them planets too.
   Segment 24
      0:01:15.080000 ---> 0:01:17.200000
      The biggest of Jupiter's moons is Ganymede.
   Segment 25
      0:01:17.200000 ---> 0:01:22.240000
      By 5,270 kilometers across, it's the biggest moon of any planet.
   Segment 26
      0:01:22.240000 ---> 0:01:24.640000
      It's even bigger than the planet Mercury.
   Segment 27
      0:01:24.640000 ---> 0:01:28.520000
      In fact, in size, it's halfway between Mercury and Mars.
   Segment 28
      0:01:28.520000 ---> 0:01:31.320000
      Size isn't the only planet like characteristic of Ganymede either.
   Segment 29
      0:01:31.320000 ---> 0:01:34.960000
      It's mostly rock and ice, but it probably has a liquid iron core.
   Segment 30
      0:01:34.960000 ---> 0:01:38
      It even has a magnetic field, likely generated by that liquid core.
   Segment 31
      0:01:38 ---> 0:01:41.840000
      The surface is similar to our own moon, in that there's very old crater terrain, as
   Segment 32
      0:01:41.840000 ---> 0:01:43.840000
      well as smoother, younger areas.
   Segment 33
      0:01:43.840000 ---> 0:01:46.800000
      Ganymede is also crisscrossed with large grooves.
   Segment 34
      0:01:46.800000 ---> 0:01:50.520000
      It's not clear what the origin of those grooves is, but it may be related to stress
   Segment 35
      0:01:50.520000 ---> 0:01:55.340000
      and strain on the surface, caused by the tides from the other large moons as they orbit
   Segment 36
      0:01:55.340000 ---> 0:01:56.720000
      Jupiter and pass each other.
   Segment 37
      0:01:56.720000 ---> 0:01:59.080000
      Ganymede has a surprise well below its surface too.
   Segment 38
      0:01:59.080000 ---> 0:02:00.720000
      Oceans of water.
   Segment 39
      0:02:00.720000 ---> 0:02:04.120000
      Measurements of Ganymede's magnetic field, made during multiple passes by the Galileo
   Segment 40
      0:02:04.120000 ---> 0:02:08.920000
      spacecraft in the 1990s, combined with Hubble observations of the moon, indicate Ganymede
   Segment 41
      0:02:08.920000 ---> 0:02:12.920000
      has quite a bit of salty, liquid water deep beneath its surface.
   Segment 42
      0:02:12.920000 ---> 0:02:15.520000
      As we'll see in a sec, it's not alone in that regard.
   Segment 43
      0:02:15.520000 ---> 0:02:19.120000
      The next biggest moon is Callisto, at 4800 km in diameter.
   Segment 44
      0:02:19.120000 ---> 0:02:22.920000
      In many ways, it's similar to its big brother Ganymede, mostly rock and ice.
   Segment 45
      0:02:22.920000 ---> 0:02:26.720000
      It probably has a rocky core, then a layer of mixed rock and ice above that.
   Segment 46
      0:02:26.720000 ---> 0:02:29.840000
      The surface is mostly ice, but mixed with darker material as well.
   Segment 47
      0:02:29.840000 ---> 0:02:33.440000
      It has a magnetic field too, but it probably doesn't have a metallic core.
   Segment 48
      0:02:33.440000 ---> 0:02:37.080000
      The surface is heavily cratered, and there's no indication of any volcanoes or tectonic
   Segment 49
      0:02:37.080000 ---> 0:02:38.080000
      activity.
   Segment 50
      0:02:38.080000 ---> 0:02:41.400000
      That means the surface is very old, maybe as old as Callisto itself.
   Segment 51
      0:02:41.400000 ---> 0:02:46
      It even has an atmosphere, but it's a tad thin, roughly 1-100 billionth the pressure
   Segment 52
      0:02:46 ---> 0:02:47.160000
      of Earth's air at the surface.
   Segment 53
      0:02:47.160000 ---> 0:02:51.240000
      Callisto orbits Jupiter farthest out of the four biggies, almost 2 million kilometers
   Segment 54
      0:02:51.240000 ---> 0:02:52.240000
      away.
   Segment 55
      0:02:52.240000 ---> 0:02:54.640000
      That's too far to gravitationally interact with the other three.
   Segment 56
      0:02:54.640000 ---> 0:02:58.720000
      When I talk about the moons affecting each other, it's really the other three interacting.
   Segment 57
      0:02:58.720000 ---> 0:02:59.720000
      Next up is Io.
   Segment 58
      0:02:59.720000 ---> 0:03:03.720000
      It's only a little bit bigger than our own moon, and orbits Jupiter so tightly, it only
   Segment 59
      0:03:03.720000 ---> 0:03:06.080000
      takes about a day and a half to go around the planet.
   Segment 60
      0:03:06.080000 ---> 0:03:11.240000
      When the Voyager 1 Space Pro passed Io in 1979, it revealed a surface that was really
   Segment 61
      0:03:11.240000 ---> 0:03:12.240000
      weird.
   Segment 62
      0:03:12.240000 ---> 0:03:15.880000
      It was yellow, and orange, and red, and black, and didn't seem to have any obvious impact
   Segment 63
      0:03:15.880000 ---> 0:03:16.880000
      creators.
   Segment 64
      0:03:16.880000 ---> 0:03:20.760000
      An engineer, Linda Morabito, noticed that in one image, there appeared to be what looked
   Segment 65
      0:03:20.760000 ---> 0:03:24.240000
      like another moon behind Io, partially eclipsed by it.
   Segment 66
      0:03:24.240000 ---> 0:03:25.560000
      But that was no moon.
   Segment 67
      0:03:25.560000 ---> 0:03:30.600000
      It was a volcano on Io erupting, its plume shooting up from the surface and opening up
   Segment 68
      0:03:30.600000 ---> 0:03:31.600000
      into a wide arc.
   Segment 69
      0:03:31.600000 ---> 0:03:37.160000
      Io is the most volcanic object in the entire solar system, with over 400 active volcanoes.
   Segment 70
      0:03:37.160000 ---> 0:03:39.200000
      Quite a few of them are erupting at any given time.
   Segment 71
      0:03:39.200000 ---> 0:03:43.160000
      An image is taken even a few months apart, show changes in the surface due to ejected
   Segment 72
      0:03:43.160000 ---> 0:03:44.160000
      material.
   Segment 73
      0:03:44.160000 ---> 0:03:47
      A lot of the eruptive material is rich in sulfur, which is why the surface has all
   Segment 74
      0:03:47 ---> 0:03:48.320000
      those odd colors on it.
   Segment 75
      0:03:48.320000 ---> 0:03:51.120000
      The energy for all this activity comes from the other moons.
   Segment 76
      0:03:51.120000 ---> 0:03:55.680000
      As they pass Io in their orbits, they flex it via tides, heating its interior through
   Segment 77
      0:03:55.680000 ---> 0:03:56.680000
      friction.
   Segment 78
      0:03:56.680000 ---> 0:03:59.520000
      A lot of that sulfur ends up as a very thin atmosphere around Io.
   Segment 79
      0:03:59.520000 ---> 0:04:03.480000
      And some of those sulfur atoms are then picked up by Jupiter's powerful magnetic field,
   Segment 80
      0:04:03.480000 ---> 0:04:06.900000
      as it sweeps past Io and accelerates them to very high speeds.
   Segment 81
      0:04:06.900000 ---> 0:04:10.980000
      This has created a tremendous donut-shaped radiation belt around Jupiter, like Earth's
   Segment 82
      0:04:10.980000 ---> 0:04:13.260000
      Van Allen belts, but far more powerful.
   Segment 83
      0:04:13.260000 ---> 0:04:17.700000
      The radiation there is so intense it would kill an unprotected human in minutes.
   Segment 84
      0:04:17.700000 ---> 0:04:21.940000
      Of course, if you're floating in space near Jupiter unprotected, you might have some more
   Segment 85
      0:04:21.940000 ---> 0:04:22.940000
      immediate concerns.
   Segment 86
      0:04:22.940000 ---> 0:04:24.260000
      Oh, one more thing.
   Segment 87
      0:04:24.260000 ---> 0:04:27.380000
      Both Ganymede and Io are magnetically connected to Jupiter.
   Segment 88
      0:04:27.380000 ---> 0:04:31.620000
      Charge particles flow from those moons along the lines of magnetism to Jupiter, which then
   Segment 89
      0:04:31.620000 ---> 0:04:35.220000
      slams them down at Jupiter's poles, just like the Earth does with the particles from the
   Segment 90
      0:04:35.220000 ---> 0:04:36.220000
      solar wind.
   Segment 91
      0:04:36.220000 ---> 0:04:40.660000
      On Earth, this creates the aurora, the northern and southern lights, and it does it Jupiter
   Segment 92
      0:04:40.660000 ---> 0:04:41.660000
      too.
   Segment 93
      0:04:41.660000 ---> 0:04:45.020000
      You can even see the ultraviolet glow where each of the moons connects to Jupiter.
   Segment 94
      0:04:45.020000 ---> 0:04:47.860000
      Their magnetic footprints in the planet's atmosphere.
   Segment 95
      0:04:47.860000 ---> 0:04:52.400000
      And now we come to Europa, the smallest but perhaps most exciting of all the Galilean
   Segment 96
      0:04:52.400000 ---> 0:04:53.400000
      moons.
   Segment 97
      0:04:53.400000 ---> 0:04:57.740000
      Slightly smaller than our moon, it was known for decades to be very reflective, meaning
   Segment 98
      0:04:57.740000 ---> 0:05:00.620000
      its surface was probably loaded with water ice.
   Segment 99
      0:05:00.620000 ---> 0:05:03.580000
      But even so, the Voyager observations were shocking.
   Segment 100
      0:05:03.580000 ---> 0:05:08.060000
      They showed a surface completely lacking in craters, meaning something had resurfaced
   Segment 101
      0:05:08.060000 ---> 0:05:12.180000
      the moon like Io or Venus, but Europa has no volcanoes.
   Segment 102
      0:05:12.180000 ---> 0:05:16.980000
      Even more intriguing, the surface was covered in long cracks, dark streaks all over the
   Segment 103
      0:05:16.980000 ---> 0:05:19.300000
      moon, as well as complex ridges.
   Segment 104
      0:05:19.300000 ---> 0:05:23.460000
      These and other features appear to be due to material from the interior of Europa welling
   Segment 105
      0:05:23.460000 ---> 0:05:27.300000
      up and forming the new surface, kind of like the way lava does on Earth.
   Segment 106
      0:05:27.300000 ---> 0:05:29.940000
      But in this case, the material is water.
   Segment 107
      0:05:29.940000 ---> 0:05:34.540000
      It's now thought that Europa has an entire ocean of water sealed up under a solid crust
   Segment 108
      0:05:34.540000 ---> 0:05:36.980000
      of ice several kilometers thick.
   Segment 109
      0:05:36.980000 ---> 0:05:41.500000
      Water welling up and moving under the crust causes it to shift, creating all the various
   Segment 110
      0:05:41.500000 ---> 0:05:42.500000
      surface features.
   Segment 111
      0:05:42.500000 ---> 0:05:46.540000
      The amount of water that may be locked up on Europa is staggering, easily more than
   Segment 112
      0:05:46.540000 ---> 0:05:49.420000
      all the water in all the oceans on Earth.
   Segment 113
      0:05:49.420000 ---> 0:05:54.180000
      Like Ganymede and Io, the interior of Europa is kept warm by tidal flexing from the other
   Segment 114
      0:05:54.180000 ---> 0:05:56.060000
      moons, keeping the ice melted.
   Segment 115
      0:05:56.060000 ---> 0:06:00.500000
      Now get this, a lot of Europa's material is silicate rock, like on Earth and other
   Segment 116
      0:06:00.500000 ---> 0:06:03.860000
      terrestrial planets, located in a layer under the ocean.
   Segment 117
      0:06:03.860000 ---> 0:06:07.620000
      If this interacts with the ocean in the same way Earth's oceans interact with the sea
   Segment 118
      0:06:07.620000 ---> 0:06:11.300000
      floor, this could make the subsurface of Europa and water salty.
   Segment 119
      0:06:11.300000 ---> 0:06:15.140000
      In fact, those dark cracks on the surface have been found to be rich in salt and organic
   Segment 120
      0:06:15.140000 ---> 0:06:18.380000
      materials, in other words, carbon-based compounds.
   Segment 121
      0:06:18.380000 ---> 0:06:19.860000
      This is pretty exciting!
   Segment 122
      0:06:19.860000 ---> 0:06:23.380000
      We think Earth's life originated in salty ocean water.
   Segment 123
      0:06:23.380000 ---> 0:06:27.940000
      If there are carbon-based molecules actually in Europa's water, it's not too crazy to
   Segment 124
      0:06:27.940000 ---> 0:06:32.140000
      wonder if the same spark that occurred here also happened there.
   Segment 125
      0:06:32.140000 ---> 0:06:35.780000
      We think Europa has everything it needs to spawn life.
   Segment 126
      0:06:35.780000 ---> 0:06:37.860000
      We just don't have any direct evidence of it yet.
   Segment 127
      0:06:37.860000 ---> 0:06:42.260000
      Some people have proposed sending a space probe to Europa specifically to look for life.
   Segment 128
      0:06:42.260000 ---> 0:06:46.260000
      It would land near a crack in the ice where the crust is thinner, and somehow penetrate
   Segment 129
      0:06:46.260000 ---> 0:06:48.140000
      it, perhaps melting its way down.
   Segment 130
      0:06:48.140000 ---> 0:06:51.180000
      Chemical sampling could then look for signs of biological activity.
   Segment 131
      0:06:51.180000 ---> 0:06:52.820000
      It's amazing to me.
   Segment 132
      0:06:52.820000 ---> 0:06:58.040000
      The idea of life in Europa, even if it's just microbial life, is taken very seriously
   Segment 133
      0:06:58.040000 ---> 0:07:01.820000
      by astrobiologists, scientists who study the possibility of life in space.
   Segment 134
      0:07:01.820000 ---> 0:07:03.700000
      It used to be science fiction.
   Segment 135
      0:07:03.700000 ---> 0:07:06.580000
      Now it's a topic of scholarly research.
   Segment 136
      0:07:06.580000 ---> 0:07:08.660000
      Astronomers have a concept called the habitable zone.
   Segment 137
      0:07:08.660000 ---> 0:07:12.220000
      The distance a planet can be from its parent star, where the temperature on the planet's
   Segment 138
      0:07:12.220000 ---> 0:07:14.220000
      surface can support liquid water.
   Segment 139
      0:07:14.220000 ---> 0:07:15.460000
      It's a fuzzy concept.
   Segment 140
      0:07:15.460000 ---> 0:07:20.220000
      Venus and Mars are both technically in the Sun's habitable zone, but Venus is too hot,
   Segment 141
      0:07:20.220000 ---> 0:07:22.540000
      and Mars too cold for liquid water.
   Segment 142
      0:07:22.540000 ---> 0:07:26.420000
      Atmospheres make a big difference, but it's still a useful concept as a rule of thumb
   Segment 143
      0:07:26.420000 ---> 0:07:27.860000
      for potential habitability.
   Segment 144
      0:07:27.860000 ---> 0:07:29.300000
      But Europa changed that.
   Segment 145
      0:07:29.300000 ---> 0:07:32.540000
      Jupiter is way, way outside the Sun's habitable zone.
   Segment 146
      0:07:32.540000 ---> 0:07:34.420000
      Yet there's Europa, all wet.
   Segment 147
      0:07:34.420000 ---> 0:07:38.380000
      It's a great example that we need to let our ideas breathe a bit sometimes.
   Segment 148
      0:07:38.380000 ---> 0:07:41.420000
      Let them relax and flow outside the boundaries we set for them.
   Segment 149
      0:07:41.420000 ---> 0:07:45.660000
      When we look for signs of life on planets orbiting other stars, I bet we'll have to
   Segment 150
      0:07:45.660000 ---> 0:07:49.420000
      keep our minds open to types of life we've never considered before.
   Segment 151
      0:07:49.420000 ---> 0:07:53.900000
      Those are just the four big moons of Jupiter, each thousands of kilometers across.
   Segment 152
      0:07:53.900000 ---> 0:07:59.300000
      They probably formed along with Jupiter, coalescing from the eddies and whorls around the proto-Jupiter,
   Segment 153
      0:07:59.300000 ---> 0:08:00.940000
      as it formed billions of years ago.
   Segment 154
      0:08:00.940000 ---> 0:08:03.220000
      But the planet has dozens of other moons, too.
   Segment 155
      0:08:03.220000 ---> 0:08:06.740000
      About the only thing they all have in common is that they're tidally locked to Jupiter.
   Segment 156
      0:08:06.740000 ---> 0:08:09.660000
      They all rotate once for every time they go around the planet.
   Segment 157
      0:08:09.660000 ---> 0:08:13.380000
      Jupiter's tides are hundreds of times stronger than Earth, so no surprise there.
   Segment 158
      0:08:13.380000 ---> 0:08:16.700000
      The next biggest moon after the big four is way smaller.
   Segment 159
      0:08:16.700000 ---> 0:08:21.700000
      With Amalthea, it's an irregular lump about 250 kilometers across its longest dimension.
   Segment 160
      0:08:21.700000 ---> 0:08:26.740000
      It was discovered in 1892, and it's red, probably polluted by sulfur from Iowa.
   Segment 161
      0:08:26.740000 ---> 0:08:30.500000
      It orbits just over 100,000 kilometers from Jupiter's cloud tops.
   Segment 162
      0:08:30.500000 ---> 0:08:34.140000
      If you stood on Amalthea's surface, Jupiter would fill half the sky.
   Segment 163
      0:08:34.140000 ---> 0:08:38.980000
      The moons get smaller and more irregularly shaped from there, with Himalaya, and Thebe,
   Segment 164
      0:08:38.980000 ---> 0:08:44.420000
      and Alara, and Passafay, down to Hegemini, and Kale, and Kalachore, which are no bigger
   Segment 165
      0:08:44.420000 ---> 0:08:45.700000
      than hills.
   Segment 166
      0:08:45.700000 ---> 0:08:50.020000
      Many of the irregular distant moons of Jupiter orbit the planet backwards relative to the
   Segment 167
      0:08:50.020000 ---> 0:08:52.540000
      others in what are called retrograde orbits.
   Segment 168
      0:08:52.540000 ---> 0:08:55.300000
      They may be captured asteroids from the nearby asteroid belt.
   Segment 169
      0:08:55.300000 ---> 0:08:59.300000
      Many of the moons have orbital characteristics that are very similar, too, which may indicate
   Segment 170
      0:08:59.300000 ---> 0:09:01.940000
      they were once a single object that broke up.
   Segment 171
      0:09:01.940000 ---> 0:09:03.700000
      Several such families of moons orbit Jupiter.
   Segment 172
      0:09:03.700000 ---> 0:09:07.180000
      The smallest moons we've seen are roughly a kilometer across.
   Segment 173
      0:09:07.180000 ---> 0:09:10.700000
      If they were sitting on Earth, they might be hard to peddle up on a bicycle, but orbiting
   Segment 174
      0:09:10.700000 ---> 0:09:13.100000
      Jupiter, they hardly rate as more than debris.
   Segment 175
      0:09:13.100000 ---> 0:09:17.100000
      There are probably thousands of moons the size of houses circling the planet.
   Segment 176
      0:09:17.100000 ---> 0:09:19.740000
      And who knows, maybe millions the size of tennis balls.
   Segment 177
      0:09:19.740000 ---> 0:09:21.780000
      Should we even call those moons?
   Segment 178
      0:09:21.780000 ---> 0:09:22.780000
      Maybe.
   Segment 179
      0:09:22.780000 ---> 0:09:24.740000
      But I don't really worry about that kind of thing.
   Segment 180
      0:09:24.740000 ---> 0:09:29.340000
      The important thing to remember is that these are worlds big and small, each fascinating,
   Segment 181
      0:09:29.340000 ---> 0:09:33.420000
      rich and diverse, and there's still a lot more left to explore about them.
   Segment 182
      0:09:33.420000 ---> 0:09:37.420000
      Today you learn that Jupiter has lots of moons, and four big ones.
   Segment 183
      0:09:37.420000 ---> 0:09:42.220000
      They're mostly rock and ice, though Ganymede, the biggest, may have an iron core.
   Segment 184
      0:09:42.220000 ---> 0:09:47.060000
      Bio is riddled with volcanoes, and Europa has an under-surface ocean that is the object
   Segment 185
      0:09:47.060000 ---> 0:09:50.420000
      of intense study for scientists looking for life and space.
   Segment 186
      0:09:50.420000 ---> 0:09:54.740000
      Bio, Europa, and Ganymede are close enough to interact gravitationally, providing a source
   Segment 187
      0:09:54.740000 ---> 0:09:56.500000
      of heat for their interiors.
   Segment 188
      0:09:56.500000 ---> 0:09:59.940000
      There are lots and lots of littler moons, but at the moment we really don't know much
   Segment 189
      0:09:59.940000 ---> 0:10:00.940000
      about them.
   Segment 190
      0:10:00.940000 ---> 0:10:05.620000
      Someday Crash Course Astronomy is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios, and

Transcription for Life on Europa#.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:08.640000
      This week, NASA announced even more evidence of plumes erupting from the surface of Jupiter's
   Segment 2
      0:00:08.640000 ---> 0:00:09.640000
      moon Europa.
   Segment 3
      0:00:09.640000 ---> 0:00:15.440000
      We're becoming increasingly sure that there's a vast ocean of water beneath Europa's
   Segment 4
      0:00:15.440000 ---> 0:00:16.440000
      icy crust.
   Segment 5
      0:00:16.440000 ---> 0:00:25.040000
      But does that ocean harbor life?
   Segment 6
      0:00:25.040000 ---> 0:00:29.720000
      This new evidence of water plumes was found by the Hubble Space Telescope, which took
   Segment 7
      0:00:29.720000 ---> 0:00:34
      ultraviolet images as Europa passed in front of Jupiter.
   Segment 8
      0:00:34 ---> 0:00:39.320000
      Sporadic jets of something appeared to block some of Jupiter's lights.
   Segment 9
      0:00:39.320000 ---> 0:00:43
      That material seems to be erupting from Europa's south pole.
   Segment 10
      0:00:43 ---> 0:00:48.160000
      This is roughly the same location where a plume of hydrogen and oxygen ions was also
   Segment 11
      0:00:48.160000 ---> 0:00:49.880000
      seen by Hubble.
   Segment 12
      0:00:49.880000 ---> 0:00:55.920000
      The finding makes it even more likely that a vast ocean of liquid water exists beneath
   Segment 13
      0:00:55.920000 ---> 0:00:58.200000
      Europa's icy crust.
   Segment 14
      0:00:58.200000 ---> 0:01:03.600000
      The moon is increasingly looked at as our best chance to find extraterrestrial life in our
   Segment 15
      0:01:03.600000 ---> 0:01:04.600000
      solar system.
   Segment 16
      0:01:04.600000 ---> 0:01:10.840000
      Today, I want to talk about why Europa looks so good for life and exactly what form that
   Segment 17
      0:01:10.840000 ---> 0:01:12.480000
      life might take.
   Segment 18
      0:01:12.480000 ---> 0:01:17.120000
      At least on Earth, liquid water is absolutely essential for life.
   Segment 19
      0:01:17.120000 ---> 0:01:20.440000
      Green-owned life form needs at least a little bit.
   Segment 20
      0:01:20.440000 ---> 0:01:25.240000
      Having water on Europa doesn't guarantee life there, but it sure makes it more likely.
   Segment 21
      0:01:25.240000 ---> 0:01:29
      But Europa isn't the only gas giant moon with a possible ice-covered ocean.
   Segment 22
      0:01:29 ---> 0:01:34.200000
      Jupiter's moon Ganymede almost certainly has one, and Callisto may or may not.
   Segment 23
      0:01:34.200000 ---> 0:01:40.120000
      Saturn's Enceladus also blasts guises from its icy surface, so we're pretty sure there's
   Segment 24
      0:01:40.120000 ---> 0:01:41.840000
      an ocean down there too.
   Segment 25
      0:01:41.840000 ---> 0:01:45.560000
      Europa's probable water vapor plumes make an ocean very likely.
   Segment 26
      0:01:46.040000 ---> 0:01:51.080000
      But the moon is extra exciting because of this reddish-brown gunk that covers the surface.
   Segment 27
      0:01:51.080000 ---> 0:01:56.960000
      There's a good chance that this is sea salt, perhaps deposited by guises that produce
   Segment 28
      0:01:56.960000 ---> 0:02:02.760000
      those plumes, and then discoloured by Jupiter's intense magnetic field.
   Segment 29
      0:02:02.760000 ---> 0:02:07.960000
      A salty ocean tells us that the water must be in direct contact with the rocky surface
   Segment 30
      0:02:07.960000 ---> 0:02:09.320000
      below.
   Segment 31
      0:02:09.320000 ---> 0:02:13.760000
      And for reasons we'll get to, that's pretty important for life to have evolved there.
   Segment 32
      0:02:13.760000 ---> 0:02:18.760000
      Ganymede, on the other hand, probably has a vast second layer of ice in between its
   Segment 33
      0:02:18.760000 ---> 0:02:21.080000
      ocean and the rocky interior.
   Segment 34
      0:02:21.080000 ---> 0:02:27.760000
      Saturn's moon Enceladus, maybe just as promising as Europa, its guises actually produce one
   Segment 35
      0:02:27.760000 ---> 0:02:33.400000
      of Saturn's rings, and the Cassini spacecraft found that ring to contain salt.
   Segment 36
      0:02:33.400000 ---> 0:02:38
      Why is it so important that the ocean be in contact with the rocky interior?
   Segment 37
      0:02:38 ---> 0:02:42.320000
      Well in general, speakers life needs energy.
   Segment 38
      0:02:42.320000 ---> 0:02:47.240000
      We know that the tidal squeezing from Jupiter's gravitational field provides the energy that
   Segment 39
      0:02:47.240000 ---> 0:02:49.800000
      keeps Europa's ocean liquid.
   Segment 40
      0:02:49.800000 ---> 0:02:55.520000
      The same forces drive massive volcanic activity in its system moon Io, and so it's likely
   Segment 41
      0:02:55.520000 ---> 0:02:59.200000
      that Europa's rocky interior is also geologically active.
   Segment 42
      0:02:59.200000 ---> 0:03:03.880000
      There's a good chance that this means hydrothermal vents.
   Segment 43
      0:03:03.880000 ---> 0:03:08.880000
      These may be the perfect place for life, not just to live, but perhaps to have originally
   Segment 44
      0:03:08.880000 ---> 0:03:10.080000
      evolved.
   Segment 45
      0:03:10.080000 ---> 0:03:15.440000
      In fact, it may be that life on Earth started around its own hydrothermal vents.
   Segment 46
      0:03:15.440000 ---> 0:03:21.520000
      This is the iron sulfur world hypothesis, proposed by Gunter Vakrashalser in the 1980s.
   Segment 47
      0:03:21.520000 ---> 0:03:28
      The idea is the first simple life came into being around so-called black smokers.
   Segment 48
      0:03:28 ---> 0:03:32.640000
      Volcanic vents in the deep ocean where not just gases spew out from Earth's mantle,
   Segment 49
      0:03:32.640000 ---> 0:03:36.440000
      and water temperatures exceed 100 degrees Celsius.
   Segment 50
      0:03:36.440000 ---> 0:03:42.080000
      Sounds unpleasant, but the regions around these vents are teeming with life, 10-100,000
   Segment 51
      0:03:42.080000 ---> 0:03:45.320000
      times the density of organisms compared to the sea floor.
   Segment 52
      0:03:45.320000 ---> 0:03:49.800000
      Entire specialized ecosystems live around Earth's deep sea vents.
   Segment 53
      0:03:49.800000 ---> 0:03:55.040000
      The foundation of these are the single-celled organisms that extract energy from the hydrogen
   Segment 54
      0:03:55.040000 ---> 0:03:58
      sulfide spewing from the vents.
   Segment 55
      0:03:58 ---> 0:04:01.280000
      These support all sorts of complex life.
   Segment 56
      0:04:01.280000 ---> 0:04:05.720000
      The depths of tube worms and clusters of clams and muscles that are crawling with crabs,
   Segment 57
      0:04:05.720000 ---> 0:04:13
      snails and shrimp-like amphipods, octopi and the eel-like zoakid top the food chain.
   Segment 58
      0:04:13 ---> 0:04:19.360000
      These critters are highly adapted to the extreme temperatures and sulfur-rich environments.
   Segment 59
      0:04:19.360000 ---> 0:04:24.520000
      Perhaps the dominant life on Europa are also deep-dwelling sulfur-munching volcanic sea
   Segment 60
      0:04:24.520000 ---> 0:04:25.680000
      monsters.
   Segment 61
      0:04:25.680000 ---> 0:04:31
      If we believe the iron-sulfur world hypothesis, then deep sea vents may be where Earth life
   Segment 62
      0:04:31 ---> 0:04:32.560000
      first originated.
   Segment 63
      0:04:32.560000 ---> 0:04:38.440000
      It's believed that an energy source and a rich mineral content in liquid water are
   Segment 64
      0:04:38.440000 ---> 0:04:42.360000
      the main ingredients needed for abiogenesis.
   Segment 65
      0:04:42.360000 ---> 0:04:46.440000
      The regions surrounding hydrothermal vents have both.
   Segment 66
      0:04:46.440000 ---> 0:04:53.520000
      They may have driven a series of peculiar chemical processes enabled by the energy differential
   Segment 67
      0:04:53.520000 ---> 0:04:58.240000
      and abundant minerals produced by deep sea-black smokers.
   Segment 68
      0:04:58.240000 ---> 0:05:04.680000
      These in turn may have resulted in a sort of prebiotic chemical metabolism that enabled
   Segment 69
      0:05:04.680000 ---> 0:05:07.120000
      evolution into true life.
   Segment 70
      0:05:07.120000 ---> 0:05:12.800000
      If this is right, there's every reason to hope that the same may have happened on Europa,
   Segment 71
      0:05:12.800000 ---> 0:05:19.600000
      but regardless of the truth behind this hypothesis, or even the existence of vents on Europa,
   Segment 72
      0:05:19.600000 ---> 0:05:25.200000
      if that moon's ocean is in contact with a warm mineral-rich ocean floor, then perhaps
   Segment 73
      0:05:25.200000 ---> 0:05:26.880000
      life is found away.
   Segment 74
      0:05:26.880000 ---> 0:05:33.040000
      Now that Europa is estimated to be 100km deep, so it's going to take a long long while
   Segment 75
      0:05:33.040000 ---> 0:05:37.360000
      before we can get a probe down to those vents if they exist.
   Segment 76
      0:05:37.360000 ---> 0:05:42.280000
      However, if life is abundant enough there, then it'll have left its mark on the rest
   Segment 77
      0:05:42.280000 ---> 0:05:43.760000
      of the ocean.
   Segment 78
      0:05:43.760000 ---> 0:05:50.160000
      Biologous, isotopic ratios, even preferential handedness, chirality of certain molecules
   Segment 79
      0:05:50.160000 ---> 0:05:53.560000
      can give away the presence of biological processes.
   Segment 80
      0:05:53.560000 ---> 0:05:59.480000
      We may find this evidence on or just beneath the icy surface, or even in Europa's vapor
   Segment 81
      0:05:59.480000 ---> 0:06:00.480000
      plumes.
   Segment 82
      0:06:00.480000 ---> 0:06:04.160000
      But if life started at those vents, who's to say it stayed there?
   Segment 83
      0:06:04.160000 ---> 0:06:08.640000
      Another promising habitat for your open life also has an earthly analogue.
   Segment 84
      0:06:08.640000 ---> 0:06:11.240000
      That's the under-service of the ice.
   Segment 85
      0:06:11.240000 ---> 0:06:16.440000
      That surface is by far the most densely populated region in the oceans beneath the Antarctic
   Segment 86
      0:06:16.440000 ---> 0:06:17.440000
      sea ice.
   Segment 87
      0:06:17.440000 ---> 0:06:22.040000
      Cravises and caves beneath the ice provide protective habitats, and the process of melting
   Segment 88
      0:06:22.040000 ---> 0:06:27
      and re-freezing produces an energy gradient that can power metabolisms.
   Segment 89
      0:06:27 ---> 0:06:28.720000
      So what does that life look like?
   Segment 90
      0:06:28.720000 ---> 0:06:33.360000
      If Earth's ice-loving organisms are anything to judge by, then we're again talking single-celled
   Segment 91
      0:06:33.360000 ---> 0:06:34.600000
      organisms.
   Segment 92
      0:06:34.600000 ---> 0:06:39.200000
      But a number of complex species also live in these frigid environments.
   Segment 93
      0:06:39.200000 ---> 0:06:43.320000
      Several types of fish, for example, have antifreeze powers.
   Segment 94
      0:06:43.320000 ---> 0:06:47.720000
      Proteins that protect their fluids from freezing, and live as they can extract ice crystals
   Segment 95
      0:06:47.720000 ---> 0:06:48.720000
      from their blood.
   Segment 96
      0:06:48.720000 ---> 0:06:53.480000
      But why restrict ourselves to the ocean floor or ocean roof?
   Segment 97
      0:06:53.480000 ---> 0:06:56.160000
      Life is found throughout Earth's oceans.
   Segment 98
      0:06:56.160000 ---> 0:06:58.800000
      However, ours are much shallower.
   Segment 99
      0:06:58.800000 ---> 0:07:03.600000
      11 kilometres are the deepest, and life throughout those depths depends on biological activity
   Segment 100
      0:07:03.600000 ---> 0:07:05.040000
      at the surface.
   Segment 101
      0:07:05.040000 ---> 0:07:10.280000
      Ultimately, their energy and nutrients come from sun-light-powered microorganisms like
   Segment 102
      0:07:10.280000 ---> 0:07:13.600000
      algae and plankton at the ocean surface.
   Segment 103
      0:07:13.600000 ---> 0:07:19.200000
      Europa's ocean roof doesn't have an abundant energy source, and certainly not one that
   Segment 104
      0:07:19.200000 ---> 0:07:22.120000
      could power a hundred kilometre deep biosphere.
   Segment 105
      0:07:22.120000 ---> 0:07:26.800000
      But who knows, it may be that the ocean floor vents are blasting enough energy and nutrients
   Segment 106
      0:07:26.800000 ---> 0:07:33.920000
      upwards to support all those alien whale things and tentacled monstrosities and merperson
   Segment 107
      0:07:33.920000 ---> 0:07:37.600000
      cities that I know we're all really hoping to find.
   Segment 108
      0:07:37.600000 ---> 0:07:39.280000
      So when will we know?
   Segment 109
      0:07:39.280000 ---> 0:07:44.960000
      NASA's Europa Clipper is expected to launch in the 2020s and will vastly improve our
   Segment 110
      0:07:44.960000 ---> 0:07:46.680000
      knowledge of the Moon.
   Segment 111
      0:07:46.680000 ---> 0:07:50.240000
      The original plan was a lightweight spacecraft carrying several instruments.
   Segment 112
      0:07:50.240000 ---> 0:07:56.280000
      It would survey the surface with high-resolution imaging and infrared scans, probe the interior
   Segment 113
      0:07:56.280000 ---> 0:08:01.960000
      with radar and magnetic mapping, and use a variety of instruments to sniff out the chemical
   Segment 114
      0:08:01.960000 ---> 0:08:07.800000
      composition of the atmosphere, surface deposits, and the giant vapor plumes.
   Segment 115
      0:08:07.800000 ---> 0:08:12.800000
      The observations taken with these instruments would then help NASA decide a promising site
   Segment 116
      0:08:12.800000 ---> 0:08:15.160000
      for a future possible lander.
   Segment 117
      0:08:15.160000 ---> 0:08:21.080000
      However, in its 2016 budget, Congress threw a spanner in the works.
   Segment 118
      0:08:21.080000 ---> 0:08:22.600000
      Well, sort of.
   Segment 119
      0:08:22.600000 ---> 0:08:29.200000
      They allocated a lot more money to NASA's Europa program than requested, but also added
   Segment 120
      0:08:29.200000 ---> 0:08:35.960000
      a mandate that NASA included a lander on the mission and that it launched by 2022.
   Segment 121
      0:08:35.960000 ---> 0:08:40.720000
      That'd be great and all, except it adds a lot of extra weight and development time
   Segment 122
      0:08:40.720000 ---> 0:08:44.880000
      to the mission, and it also makes it pretty hard for NASA to scout out the best landing
   Segment 123
      0:08:44.880000 ---> 0:08:45.880000
      spot.
   Segment 124
      0:08:45.880000 ---> 0:08:50.960000
      NASA is considering doing this as two separate missions, if that's even allowed under Congress's
   Segment 125
      0:08:50.960000 ---> 0:08:51.960000
      decree.
   Segment 126
      0:08:51.960000 ---> 0:08:56.320000
      We might wonder whether we should just let NASA do what it does best, but it's hard to
   Segment 127
      0:08:56.320000 ---> 0:09:01.120000
      turn down extra funding, so let's see what those geniuses at NASA couldn't come up with.
   Segment 128
      0:09:01.120000 ---> 0:09:06.360000
      On the other hand, we may learn a lot even before a new probe reaches Europa.
   Segment 129
      0:09:06.360000 ---> 0:09:11.200000
      By training Hubble spectrographs on Europa, it may be possible to see the absorption of
   Segment 130
      0:09:11.200000 ---> 0:09:16.880000
      Jupiter's light due to specific molecules in those water plumes, molecules that tell
   Segment 131
      0:09:16.880000 ---> 0:09:21.480000
      us even more about the plausibility of life in that ocean.
   Segment 132
      0:09:21.480000 ---> 0:09:26.520000
      But to really know, we probably do need to land that probe and somehow peer beneath
   Segment 133
      0:09:26.520000 ---> 0:09:27.520000
      the ice.
   Segment 134
      0:09:27.520000 ---> 0:09:29.680000
      Who knows what we'll see?
   Segment 135
      0:09:29.680000 ---> 0:09:33.960000
      Give us your best guess in the comments, and we'll see you next week on Space Time.
   Segment 136
      0:09:33.960000 ---> 0:09:38.600000
      Last week we talked about the weirdness of quantum entanglement and the implications its
   Segment 137
      0:09:38.600000 ---> 0:09:42.160000
      results have for the nature of reality.
   Segment 138
      0:09:42.160000 ---> 0:09:45.320000
      Unsurprisingly you guys had a lot to say.
   Segment 139
      0:09:45.320000 ---> 0:09:51.400000
      A couple of you asked what result you would get if you measured one particle with a vertically
   Segment 140
      0:09:51.400000 ---> 0:09:56.480000
      aligned measurement device and the second particle with a horizontally aligned device.
   Segment 141
      0:09:56.480000 ---> 0:10:02.680000
      Okay, so first, the simplest observable difference between the predictions of a local hidden
   Segment 142
      0:10:02.680000 ---> 0:10:08.120000
      variable theory versus pure quantum mechanics is if you measure the spins of both particles
   Segment 143
      0:10:08.120000 ---> 0:10:10.120000
      with the same measurement axis.
   Segment 144
      0:10:10.120000 ---> 0:10:15.500000
      In that case, the pure quantum no hidden variable prediction is that you'll always measure
   Segment 145
      0:10:15.500000 ---> 0:10:17.240000
      opposite spins.
   Segment 146
      0:10:17.320000 ---> 0:10:21.720000
      With the local hidden variable theory, you'd expect to sometimes measure spins in the
   Segment 147
      0:10:21.720000 ---> 0:10:26.800000
      same direction depending on the relationship of the chosen measurement axis with the hidden
   Segment 148
      0:10:26.800000 ---> 0:10:29.160000
      spins of the particle.
   Segment 149
      0:10:29.160000 ---> 0:10:35.040000
      If instead you measure one spin in one direction and the other at 90 degrees, then the pure
   Segment 150
      0:10:35.040000 ---> 0:10:40.120000
      quantum prediction is that the second particle is aligned one way 50% of the time and the
   Segment 151
      0:10:40.120000 ---> 0:10:42.240000
      other way 50% of the time.
   Segment 152
      0:10:42.240000 ---> 0:10:48.240000
      Just because the measurement of its entangled twin forces its alignment to be 90 degrees
   Segment 153
      0:10:48.240000 ---> 0:10:54.200000
      to its own measurement axis that leads to 50% alignment in either direction.
   Segment 154
      0:10:54.200000 ---> 0:11:00
      By contrast, a local hidden variable prediction is that the second particle doesn't care how
   Segment 155
      0:11:00 ---> 0:11:05.520000
      the first was measured so it aligns itself according to its original spin which probably
   Segment 156
      0:11:05.520000 ---> 0:11:08.480000
      won't lead to an even 50-50 split.
   Segment 157
      0:11:08.480000 ---> 0:11:13.400000
      Alex Trusk very reasonably asks me to define what I mean by observer.
   Segment 158
      0:11:13.400000 ---> 0:11:18.560000
      So I've done this in a couple of the quantum videos before but it bears repeating.
   Segment 159
      0:11:18.560000 ---> 0:11:23.360000
      The definition of observer sort of depends on what interpretation of quantum mechanics
   Segment 160
      0:11:23.360000 ---> 0:11:30.360000
      you're going with however no mainstream interpretations demand any sort of conscious observation.
   Segment 161
      0:11:30.360000 ---> 0:11:36
      Rather, observation may just mean any interaction that destroys quantum coherence between the
   Segment 162
      0:11:36 ---> 0:11:37.640000
      entangled particles.
   Segment 163
      0:11:37.640000 ---> 0:11:43.160000
      The way of saying that is that this measurement interaction effectively entangles the measured
   Segment 164
      0:11:43.160000 ---> 0:11:49.320000
      particle and its partner with a macroscopic system so complex that we no longer observe
   Segment 165
      0:11:49.320000 ---> 0:11:50.960000
      clean quantum effects.
   Segment 166
      0:11:50.960000 ---> 0:11:57.360000
      David 2168.6 and a couple of others point out that John Stuart Bell had another possible
   Segment 167
      0:11:57.360000 ---> 0:12:00.760000
      solution to this whole seeming paradox.
   Segment 168
      0:12:00.760000 ---> 0:12:03.440000
      That is super determinism.
   Segment 169
      0:12:03.440000 ---> 0:12:08.880000
      Now that's a huge topic and I think we'll do a video on it but for now let me give
   Segment 170
      0:12:08.880000 ---> 0:12:13.800000
      you Bell's own explanation of this way out.
   Segment 171
      0:12:13.800000 ---> 0:12:18.760000
      He says, There is a way to escape the inference of superluminal speeds and spooky action at
   Segment 172
      0:12:18.760000 ---> 0:12:23.560000
      a distance but it involves absolute determinism in the universe.
   Segment 173
      0:12:23.560000 ---> 0:12:25.960000
      The complete absence of free will.
   Segment 174
      0:12:25.960000 ---> 0:12:30.840000
      Suppose the world is super deterministic with not just inanimate objects running on behind
   Segment 175
      0:12:30.840000 ---> 0:12:34.920000
      the scenes clockwork but with our behaviour including our belief that we are free to choose
   Segment 176
      0:12:34.920000 ---> 0:12:40.200000
      to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely pre-determined.
   Segment 177
      0:12:40.200000 ---> 0:12:44.200000
      Including the decision by the experimenter to carry out one set of experiments rather
   Segment 178
      0:12:44.200000 ---> 0:12:47.200000
      than another, the difficulty disappears.
   Segment 179
      0:12:47.200000 ---> 0:12:51.160000
      There's no need for a faster than light signal to tell particle A what measurement has been
   Segment 180
      0:12:51.160000 ---> 0:12:56.480000
      carried out on particle B because the universe including particle A already knows what that
   Segment 181
      0:12:56.480000 ---> 0:13:03.480000
      measurement and its outcome will be.

Transcription for Life on the deep ocean black smokers.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:08.840000
      The Earth cracks open.
   Segment 2
      0:00:08.840000 ---> 0:00:12.120000
      Fluid and minerals spew from the seafloor.
   Segment 3
      0:00:12.120000 ---> 0:00:13.920000
      Water shimmers.
   Segment 4
      0:00:13.920000 ---> 0:00:16.120000
      Life abounds.
   Segment 5
      0:00:16.120000 ---> 0:00:18.560000
      We're looking at hydrothermal vents.
   Segment 6
      0:00:18.560000 ---> 0:00:22.960000
      Originally discovered near the Galapagos Rift in 1977.
   Segment 7
      0:00:22.960000 ---> 0:00:29.720000
      Basically, a hydrothermal vent is a hot spring produced by underwater volcanoes or tectonic
   Segment 8
      0:00:29.720000 ---> 0:00:31.440000
      activity.
   Segment 9
      0:00:31.440000 ---> 0:00:37.400000
      But what's really cool about them is the abundance and assortment of life that exists there.
   Segment 10
      0:00:37.400000 ---> 0:00:40.720000
      It's not life like we're used to up here on the surface.
   Segment 11
      0:00:40.720000 ---> 0:00:44.800000
      It's adapted to the dark conditions of the deep ocean.
   Segment 12
      0:00:44.800000 ---> 0:00:49.480000
      Organisms that live around hydrothermal vents don't rely on sunlight and photosynthesis.
   Segment 13
      0:00:49.480000 ---> 0:00:55.400000
      Instead, bacteria and archaea use a process called chemosynthesis to convert minerals
   Segment 14
      0:00:55.400000 ---> 0:00:58.440000
      and other chemicals in the water into energy.
   Segment 15
      0:00:58.440000 ---> 0:01:03.400000
      This bacterium is the base of the vent community food web and supports hundreds of species
   Segment 16
      0:01:03.400000 ---> 0:01:05.080000
      of animals.
   Segment 17
      0:01:05.080000 ---> 0:01:06.280000
      What kinds of animals?
   Segment 18
      0:01:06.280000 ---> 0:01:11.960000
      Well, scientists on the NOAA ship Oceanos Explorer went to the rift in 2011.
   Segment 19
      0:01:11.960000 ---> 0:01:15
      And here's just some of what they saw.
   Segment 20
      0:01:15 ---> 0:01:19.400000
      Riftia tube worms, also called giant tube worms, which can grow to their full size of

      0:01:19.400000 ---> 0:01:23
      almost 5 feet long in less than 2 years.
   Segment 22

      Bathymodilla steep sea mussels, which are often the first creatures to colonize the vent,

      0:01:27.920000 ---> 0:01:32.160000
      and are able to survive for a short time after the vent is inactive.
   Segment 24
      0:01:32.160000 ---> 0:01:37.960000
      Surplid, or feather duster worms, and tevnia tube worms, which are often the food of choice
   Segment 25
      0:01:37.960000 ---> 0:01:43.200000
      for vent crabs, the top predator of the vent community.
   Segment 26
      0:01:43.200000 ---> 0:01:45.560000
      But it's not all animals down there.
   Segment 27
      0:01:45.560000 ---> 0:01:50.120000
      Researchers also saw white flocculate material erupting from the vents like a snowblower,
   Segment 28
      0:01:50.120000 ---> 0:01:53.480000
      an indicator of microbial life beneath the sea floor.
   Segment 29
      0:01:53.480000 ---> 0:01:58.520000
      And of course, there were fresh lava flows, which means the sea floor is continuing to
   Segment 30
      0:01:58.520000 ---> 0:01:59.720000
      change.
   Segment 31
      0:01:59.720000 ---> 0:02:02.920000
      And that change means there's always more to learn.
   Segment 32
      0:02:02.920000 ---> 0:02:07.960000
      Hydrophilm events are found in isolated spots along the rift valleys of mid-ocean ridges,
   Segment 33
      0:02:07.960000 ---> 0:02:12.320000
      where seawater that has penetrated cracks in the crust has circulated down to the magma
   Segment 34
      0:02:12.320000 ---> 0:02:18.920000
      chambers, left salts behind in the cracks, and then risen to the surface, now superheated
   Segment 35
      0:02:18.920000 ---> 0:02:23.760000
      and filled with hydrogen sulfide gas from the magma chambers.
   Segment 36
      0:02:23.760000 ---> 0:02:28.960000
      On route to the surface, these hot fluids leach elements out of the ocean crust, elements
   Segment 37
      0:02:28.960000 ---> 0:02:32.760000
      like iron, copper, zinc, and even gold.
   Segment 38
      0:02:32.760000 ---> 0:02:37.600000
      When these fluids exit vents in the sea floor and mix with the cold water there, the metals
   Segment 39
      0:02:37.600000 ---> 0:02:43.960000
      get together with the sulfur and sulfide minerals precipitate out, creating mineral deposits,
   Segment 40
      0:02:43.960000 ---> 0:02:48.240000
      much like mineral deposits left behind in your water pipes.
   Segment 41
      0:02:48.240000 ---> 0:02:52.640000
      These mineral deposits grow over time into large chimneys that extend above vents in
   Segment 42
      0:02:52.640000 ---> 0:02:54.800000
      the sea floor.
   Segment 43
      0:02:54.800000 ---> 0:02:59.360000
      As previously mentioned, the hydrogen sulfide acts as an energy source for the chemosynthetic
   Segment 44
      0:02:59.360000 ---> 0:03:05.040000
      bacteria that support an exotic food web and ecosystem that is located immediately around
   Segment 45
      0:03:05.040000 ---> 0:03:06.960000
      this vent.
   Segment 46
      0:03:06.960000 ---> 0:03:12.120000
      Giant tube worms collect gardens of these chemosynthetic bacteria within their bodies.
   Segment 47
      0:03:12.120000 ---> 0:03:16.800000
      The tube worms feast on the garden, and the garden is fertilized by the waste of the tube
   Segment 48
      0:03:16.800000 ---> 0:03:22.520000
      worm, and receives gases as the tube worms extend over the vent and soak up the hydrogen
   Segment 49
      0:03:22.520000 ---> 0:03:25.440000
      sulfide gases escaping.
   Segment 50
      0:03:25.440000 ---> 0:03:30.560000
      Both the bacteria and the tube worms that act as their hosts are known as extremophiles
   Segment 51
      0:03:30.560000 ---> 0:03:33.760000
      because they can handle extreme temperatures.
   Segment 52
      0:03:33.760000 ---> 0:03:39.280000
      The vent fluids can be between 350 and 400 degrees Celsius.
   Segment 53
      0:03:39.280000 ---> 0:03:42.280000
      More animals that live around vents feed on the

Transcription for Neil deGrasse Tyson# Life on Europa, Jupiter's Moons, Ice Fishing and Racket Sports # Big Think.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:07
      Nobody doesn't love Europa.
   Segment 2
      0:00:07 ---> 0:00:10
      And let me back up.
   Segment 3
      0:00:10 ---> 0:00:13
      When we think of places you might find life,
   Segment 4
      0:00:13 ---> 0:00:17
      we typically think of the Goldilocks zone
   Segment 5
      0:00:17 ---> 0:00:19
      around a star,
   Segment 6
      0:00:19 ---> 0:00:24
      where water would be liquid in its natural state.
   Segment 7
      0:00:24 ---> 0:00:26
      And if you get a little too close to the star,
   Segment 8
      0:00:26 ---> 0:00:29
      heat would evaporate the water and you don't have it.
   Segment 9
      0:00:29 ---> 0:00:31
      Anywhere it's gone.
   Segment 10
      0:00:31 ---> 0:00:33
      Too far away would freeze.
   Segment 11
      0:00:33 ---> 0:00:38
      And neither of those states of H2O are useful to life as we know it.
   Segment 12
      0:00:38 ---> 0:00:40
      We need liquid water.
   Segment 13
      0:00:40 ---> 0:00:43
      So you can establish this green zone, this habitable zone,
   Segment 14
      0:00:43 ---> 0:00:47
      this Goldilocks zone, where if you find a planet orbiting there,
   Segment 15
      0:00:47 ---> 0:00:50
      hey, it's a good chance it could have liquid water.
   Segment 16
      0:00:50 ---> 0:00:53
      Let's look there first for life as we know it.
   Segment 17
      0:00:53 ---> 0:00:57
      Now, it turns out that this source of heat,
   Segment 18
      0:00:57 ---> 0:00:59
      the source is traceable to the sun.
   Segment 19
      0:00:59 ---> 0:01:01
      And if you go farther out,
   Segment 20
      0:01:01 ---> 0:01:03
      everything would or should be frozen,
   Segment 21
      0:01:03 ---> 0:01:05
      all other things being equal.
   Segment 22
      0:01:05 ---> 0:01:08
      But Europa, a moon of Jupiter,
   Segment 23
      0:01:08 ---> 0:01:11
      sitting well outside of the Goldilocks zone,
   Segment 24
      0:01:11 ---> 0:01:13
      is kept warm.
   Segment 25
      0:01:13 ---> 0:01:16
      Not from energy sources traceable to the sun,
   Segment 26
      0:01:16 ---> 0:01:21
      but from what we call the tidal forces of Jupiter itself.
   Segment 27
      0:01:21 ---> 0:01:24
      So Jupiter and surrounding moons
   Segment 28
      0:01:24 ---> 0:01:28
      are actually pumping energy into Europa.
   Segment 29
      0:01:28 ---> 0:01:30
      And how does it do that?
   Segment 30
      0:01:30 ---> 0:01:34
      As Europa orbits Jupiter, its shape changes.
   Segment 31
      0:01:34 ---> 0:01:39
      It's not fundamentally different from tides rising and falling on Earth.
   Segment 32
      0:01:39 ---> 0:01:44
      The shape of the water system of the Earth
   Segment 33
      0:01:44 ---> 0:01:47
      is responding to tidal forces of the moon.
   Segment 34
      0:01:47 ---> 0:01:50
      And when you do that to a solid object,
   Segment 35
      0:01:50 ---> 0:01:54
      the solid object is stressing.
   Segment 36
      0:01:54 ---> 0:01:56
      And because of this,
   Segment 37
      0:01:56 ---> 0:02:02
      a consequence of this is that you are pumping energy into the object.
   Segment 38
      0:02:02 ---> 0:02:06
      It is no different from when you say anyone who's familiar with racket sports,
   Segment 39
      0:02:06 ---> 0:02:08
      indoor racket sports,
   Segment 40
      0:02:08 ---> 0:02:10
      could be a racket ball or squash.
   Segment 41
      0:02:10 ---> 0:02:13
      You say, let's warm up the ball before we start playing.
   Segment 42
      0:02:13 ---> 0:02:15
      You want to hit it around a few times.
   Segment 43
      0:02:15 ---> 0:02:17
      You are literally warming up the ball.
   Segment 44
      0:02:17 ---> 0:02:20
      It's not just simply, let's get loose.
   Segment 45
      0:02:20 ---> 0:02:22
      You are literally warming up the ball.
   Segment 46
      0:02:22 ---> 0:02:25
      How? You are distorting it every time you smack it.
   Segment 47
      0:02:25 ---> 0:02:29
      And then the resilience of the ball pops it back into shape.
   Segment 48
      0:02:29 ---> 0:02:32
      And every time you do that, every smack,
   Segment 49
      0:02:32 ---> 0:02:34
      you're pumping energy into the ball.
   Segment 50
      0:02:34 ---> 0:02:39
      It's not fundamentally different from what's going on in orbit around Jupiter.
   Segment 51
      0:02:39 ---> 0:02:46
      So you have this frozen world, Europa, completely frozen on its surface.
   Segment 52
      0:02:46 ---> 0:02:50
      But you look at the surface and there are cracks in the ice.
   Segment 53
      0:02:50 ---> 0:02:56
      There are ridges in the ice where there's a crack and it's shifted and then refros.
   Segment 54
      0:02:56 ---> 0:03:03
      So this ridge has a discontinuity in the crack and then continues in another place.
   Segment 55
      0:03:03 ---> 0:03:10
      So what this tells you is that Europa cannot be completely frozen.
   Segment 56
      0:03:10 ---> 0:03:13
      Because if it were, nothing would be moving.
   Segment 57
      0:03:13 ---> 0:03:16
      You look at the surface of Europa, the frozen surface,
   Segment 58
      0:03:16 ---> 0:03:22
      they are like ice chunks that are like shifted and refrozen and shifted again.
   Segment 59
      0:03:22 ---> 0:03:28
      It looks just like if you fly over the, the, the Arctic Ocean.
   Segment 60
      0:03:28 ---> 0:03:31
      Fly over the Arctic Ocean in the winter.
   Segment 61
      0:03:31 ---> 0:03:34
      These are ice sheets that are breaking and refreezing all the time.
   Segment 62
      0:03:34 ---> 0:03:37
      It's the same signature as that.
   Segment 63
      0:03:37 ---> 0:03:44
      So all of us are convinced that beneath this icy surface is an ocean of liquid water.
   Segment 64
      0:03:44 ---> 0:03:49
      And there's no reason to think it wouldn't have been liquid for billions of years.
   Segment 65
      0:03:49 ---> 0:03:55
      On Earth, where we find liquid water, we find life.
   Segment 66
      0:03:55 ---> 0:03:59
      Wherever we find liquid water, we find life.
   Segment 67
      0:03:59 ---> 0:04:02
      Even places like the Dead Sea.
   Segment 68
      0:04:02 ---> 0:04:05
      Why did anybody call it a Dead Sea?
   Segment 69
      0:04:05 ---> 0:04:08
      Because the microscope hadn't yet been invented.
   Segment 70
      0:04:08 ---> 0:04:13
      And sure, maybe there's no macroscopic vertebrate fishes.
   Segment 71
      0:04:13 ---> 0:04:20
      But microbes have no problems thriving.
   Segment 72
      0:04:20 ---> 0:04:24
      And practically any condition under which you would find liquid water.
   Segment 73
      0:04:24 ---> 0:04:30
      So what this means is, not only do we have a source of heat outside of the Goldilocks zone,
   Segment 74
      0:04:30 ---> 0:04:34
      but we have conditions under which life could be thriving.
   Segment 75
      0:04:34 ---> 0:04:44
      And knowing that this is possible has completely broadened the net that we are casting in search for life in the universe.
   Segment 76
      0:04:44 ---> 0:04:52
      No longer is it that, let me, let's find a 72 degree tidal pond and see life forming there.
   Segment 77
      0:04:52 ---> 0:04:54
      No, life is pretty hardy.
   Segment 78
      0:04:54 ---> 0:05:06
      And if it takes liquid water, that may be the other place in the solar system that is teeming with some form or another of life.
   Segment 79
      0:05:06 ---> 0:05:09
      So yeah, we all want to go to Europa, period.
   Segment 80
      0:05:09 ---> 0:05:13
      We got to go ice fishing though, because you got to cut a hole or melt a hole.
   Segment 81
      0:05:13 ---> 0:05:15
      You got to get there somehow.
   Segment 82
      0:05:15 ---> 0:05:21
      Because this sheet of ice, by some estimates, are several kilometers thick.
   Segment 83
      0:05:21 ---> 0:05:24
      And so it will take some effort to get through that.
   Segment 84
      0:05:24 ---> 0:05:26
      Which we haven't really fully figured out yet.
   Segment 85
      0:05:26 ---> 0:05:29
      But it's an engineering problem, not a science problem.
   Segment 86
      0:05:29 ---> 0:05:33
      So clever engineers should be able to figure that one out.
   Segment 87
      0:05:33 ---> 0:05:41
      And by the way Europa is not the only one of these moons in the outer solar system that's kept warm by these sort of tidal stress forces.
   Segment 88
      0:05:41 ---> 0:05:46
      There are other moons that feel the same influx of energy.
   Segment 89
      0:05:46 ---> 0:05:50
      So for example, Io, that's the innermost moon of Jupiter.
   Segment 90
      0:05:50 ---> 0:05:53
      That suffers from this phenomenon even more.
   Segment 91
      0:05:53 ---> 0:05:56
      And that moon is so hot.
   Segment 92
      0:05:56 ---> 0:06:00
      There are volcanoes erupting from within.
   Segment 93
      0:06:00 ---> 0:06:06
      It is rendered molten, whatever solid parts of that moon there are.
   Segment 94
      0:06:06 ---> 0:06:17
      And so in fact, the most volcanically active place in the solar system is Io, one of the moons of Jupiter.
   Segment 95
      0:06:18 ---> 0:06:23
      And we don't know how to sustain life under temperatures that hot.
   Segment 96
      0:06:23 ---> 0:06:29
      But it's a reminder that if you're looking for sources of energy,
   Segment 97
      0:06:29 ---> 0:06:37
      we no longer need to be anchored to a host star in our search for life in the universe.

Transcription for Primate Evolution's Tangled Tree # Fundamental Concepts with Jenny Tung.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:10.320000
      So at some point in your life, you may have come across a cartoon version that attempts
   Segment 2
      0:00:10.320000 ---> 0:00:13.080000
      to depict the process of human evolution.
   Segment 3
      0:00:13.080000 ---> 0:00:17.120000
      These cartoons typically lay out a series of figures, starting from something that looks
   Segment 4
      0:00:17.120000 ---> 0:00:22.880000
      an awful lot like a modern-day chimpanzee, and then progressing through a series of cartoons
   Segment 5
      0:00:22.880000 ---> 0:00:26.240000
      that follow our species purported history through time.
   Segment 6
      0:00:26.240000 ---> 0:00:31.200000
      So you see the origins of bipedal walking, maybe the beginnings of tool use, and sometimes
   Segment 7
      0:00:31.200000 ---> 0:00:37.040000
      by the end of it in satirical versions, you'll see a picture of someone walking around looking
   Segment 8
      0:00:37.040000 ---> 0:00:42.200000
      at their cell phone or a programmer hunched over at a desk.
   Segment 9
      0:00:42.200000 ---> 0:00:44.360000
      These cartoons are usually meant as commentary.
   Segment 10
      0:00:44.360000 ---> 0:00:49.040000
      They're not meant to be serious renditions of human evolutionary history, but they do
   Segment 11
      0:00:49.040000 ---> 0:00:54.800000
      promote a major misunderstanding about how humans and other species actually evolved.
   Segment 12
      0:00:54.800000 ---> 0:01:00.200000
      So we didn't actually evolve from chimpanzees, monkeys, or other non-human primates, and
   Segment 13
      0:01:00.200000 ---> 0:01:04.360000
      there's never been a serious evolutionary biologist who's made that argument.
   Segment 14
      0:01:04.360000 ---> 0:01:09.360000
      So in fact, although this classical cartoon image implies that millions of years have
   Segment 15
      0:01:09.360000 ---> 0:01:14.080000
      passed along the bottom of these figures, that can't possibly be true.
   Segment 16
      0:01:14.080000 ---> 0:01:18.480000
      Chimpanzees, like the one at the very beginning of the series, still are found on Earth today,
   Segment 17
      0:01:18.480000 ---> 0:01:22.200000
      along with the fully modern humans seen at the end of the series.
   Segment 18
      0:01:22.200000 ---> 0:01:26.820000
      In fact, modern day chimps never co-resided with early hominins like Lucy, so they should
   Segment 19
      0:01:26.820000 ---> 0:01:29.720000
      come at the end, not the beginning.
   Segment 20
      0:01:29.720000 ---> 0:01:33.640000
      To understand why, it's useful to think about a different metaphor.
   Segment 21
      0:01:33.640000 ---> 0:01:38
      Actually the one that evolutionary biologists have been relying on since at least the time
   Segment 22
      0:01:38 ---> 0:01:39.200000
      of Darwin.
   Segment 23
      0:01:39.200000 ---> 0:01:44.560000
      That metaphor is one of the tree, where the tips of the tree, the tips of our branches,
   Segment 24
      0:01:44.560000 ---> 0:01:49.480000
      are meant to represent the current endpoints of evolutionary process, such as the species
   Segment 25
      0:01:49.480000 ---> 0:01:51.320000
      that are living on Earth today.
   Segment 26
      0:01:51.320000 ---> 0:01:55.960000
      The branches that connect the tips describe how those species are related going backwards
   Segment 27
      0:01:55.960000 ---> 0:01:57.520000
      in time.
   Segment 28
      0:01:57.520000 ---> 0:02:03.080000
      Chimpanzees, humans, and other modern primates are tips, and because chimps and bonobos are
   Segment 29
      0:02:03.080000 ---> 0:02:10.080000
      the closest living relatives of humans, today, they are the tips that come from very recent
   Segment 30
      0:02:10.080000 ---> 0:02:12.280000
      branching events.
   Segment 31
      0:02:12.280000 ---> 0:02:16.440000
      Repeated patterns of branch growth and then bifurcation, that's where one branch splits
   Segment 32
      0:02:16.440000 ---> 0:02:21.440000
      into two, can be used to describe the entire history of life on Earth, actually, is shown
   Segment 33
      0:02:21.440000 ---> 0:02:26.880000
      in some really beautiful classical drawings by early biologists like Ernst Hechkel.
   Segment 34
      0:02:26.880000 ---> 0:02:31.480000
      Our lineage, the animals, and then the vertebrates, and then the primates nested within them,
   Segment 35
      0:02:31.480000 ---> 0:02:36.840000
      can be thought as one set of the terminal branches of that much larger tree.
   Segment 36
      0:02:36.840000 ---> 0:02:39.920000
      After each split, each branch of the tree grows independently.
   Segment 37
      0:02:39.920000 ---> 0:02:45.280000
      That means it evolves independently over time, because individuals who belong to that branch
   Segment 38
      0:02:45.280000 ---> 0:02:52.680000
      no longer exchange genes, that is, interbreed with individuals that belong on separate branches.
   Segment 39
      0:02:52.680000 ---> 0:02:57.160000
      How do we know where to put different species on the tree?
   Segment 40
      0:02:57.160000 ---> 0:03:01.560000
      That is, how do we know which animals are more closely related in time and which ones are
   Segment 41
      0:03:01.560000 ---> 0:03:05.920000
      much more distantly related because their branches diverged a long time ago?
   Segment 42
      0:03:05.920000 ---> 0:03:11.160000
      Well, one important way to do this is to use data from DNA sequences, and that's the way
   Segment 43
      0:03:11.160000 ---> 0:03:14.200000
      that most biologists do so today.
   Segment 44
      0:03:14.200000 ---> 0:03:18.480000
      As groups of individuals only start evolving independently, their branches only start growing
   Segment 45
      0:03:18.480000 ---> 0:03:23.880000
      independently after their splits, species that split a long time ago will have more different
   Segment 46
      0:03:23.880000 ---> 0:03:27.800000
      DNA sequences than species that split very recently.
   Segment 47
      0:03:27.800000 ---> 0:03:32.440000
      For example, we know that chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than gorillas
   Segment 48
      0:03:32.440000 ---> 0:03:38
      are to humans, and chimpanzees, gorillas, and humans together are more closely related
   Segment 49
      0:03:38.080000 ---> 0:03:44.720000
      to each other than they are to other primate species like the African and Asian monkeys.
   Segment 50
      0:03:44.720000 ---> 0:03:48.040000
      This pattern is actually spelled out directly in our genomes.
   Segment 51
      0:03:48.040000 ---> 0:03:51.360000
      So human and chimp genomes are about 99% similar.
   Segment 52
      0:03:51.360000 ---> 0:03:56.680000
      That is, if you were walking along a set of DNA letters, A's, C's, T's, and G's, you'd
   Segment 53
      0:03:56.680000 ---> 0:04:02.680000
      have to go on average 99 letters between one copy of a human genome and one copy of a chimpanzee
   Segment 54
      0:04:02.680000 ---> 0:04:06.400000
      genome before you found a difference.
   Segment 55
      0:04:06.400000 ---> 0:04:12.640000
      When we compare gorilla genomes and human genomes, we get to about 98% similarity, so
   Segment 56
      0:04:12.640000 ---> 0:04:17.520000
      they're just a little bit more different from one another than humans are to chimpanzees.
   Segment 57
      0:04:17.520000 ---> 0:04:21.960000
      If we go to baboons, a monkey species that I study, the similarity becomes something
   Segment 58
      0:04:21.960000 ---> 0:04:23.800000
      like 94%.
   Segment 59
      0:04:23.800000 ---> 0:04:28.800000
      So we can order those levels of similarity in order to understand the branching order
   Segment 60
      0:04:28.800000 ---> 0:04:31.120000
      of different parts of the tree.
   Segment 61
      0:04:31.120000 ---> 0:04:35
      That difference doesn't sound like a lot, but it actually is at the DNA base pair that
   Segment 62
      0:04:35 ---> 0:04:36.920000
      is the individual DNA letter level.
   Segment 63
      0:04:36.920000 ---> 0:04:41.800000
      There are about 3 billion base pairs of DNA in a single copy of the human genome, so when
   Segment 64
      0:04:41.800000 ---> 0:04:46.400000
      we think about a 1% difference between humans and chimpanzees, what that actually translates
   Segment 65
      0:04:46.400000 ---> 0:04:53.720000
      to is about 30 million differences at individual letters across the genome.
   Segment 66
      0:04:53.720000 ---> 0:04:57.800000
      By comparison, if we think about two copies of the human genome, one for me and one for
   Segment 67
      0:04:57.800000 ---> 0:05:03.880000
      you, for instance, the differences are about one in every thousand instead of one in every
   Segment 68
      0:05:03.920000 ---> 0:05:05.360000
      hundred.
   Segment 69
      0:05:05.360000 ---> 0:05:10.280000
      That means that we are all, unsurprisingly, much, much, much more closely related to each
   Segment 70
      0:05:10.280000 ---> 0:05:15.080000
      other than any one of us is to another non-human primate.
   Segment 71
      0:05:15.080000 ---> 0:05:21.240000
      It also means that we all shared a common ancestor very recently back in time.
   Segment 72
      0:05:21.240000 ---> 0:05:26.280000
      So the tree is therefore one of the most important ways that evolutionary biologists and anthropologists
   Segment 73
      0:05:26.280000 ---> 0:05:28.760000
      think about the evolutionary process.
   Segment 74
      0:05:28.760000 ---> 0:05:32.720000
      But some of you may have in a head an experience walking through a forest or through a park
   Segment 75
      0:05:32.720000 ---> 0:05:36.920000
      or outside in your yard and notice that tree branches do bifurcate.
   Segment 76
      0:05:36.920000 ---> 0:05:40.960000
      They do split into two, but every once in a while you'll see branches that actually grow
   Segment 77
      0:05:40.960000 ---> 0:05:43.760000
      back together again.
   Segment 78
      0:05:43.760000 ---> 0:05:49.320000
      It turns out that that kind of process also has a parallel in human evolution.
   Segment 79
      0:05:49.320000 ---> 0:05:54.680000
      To understand how we know this, imagine a thought experiment that was posed by two anthropologist
   Segment 80
      0:05:54.680000 ---> 0:05:57.720000
      Strauss and Cave about 60 years ago.
   Segment 81
      0:05:57.720000 ---> 0:06:01.520000
      So Strauss and Cave were interested in Neanderthals and they were particularly interested in the
   Segment 82
      0:06:01.560000 ---> 0:06:04.680000
      shape of the body, the skeleton of Neanderthals.
   Segment 83
      0:06:04.680000 ---> 0:06:10.960000
      And they said, wow, these extinct relatives of humans, these other very modern human-like
   Segment 84
      0:06:10.960000 ---> 0:06:14.960000
      individuals who used to live on our planet, they were pretty similar to us.
   Segment 85
      0:06:14.960000 ---> 0:06:19.440000
      Similar enough that they said if you bathed the Neanderthal, if you shaved the Neanderthal,
   Segment 86
      0:06:19.440000 ---> 0:06:23.640000
      if you put them in modern clothing and then stuck them on the New York subway, probably
   Segment 87
      0:06:23.640000 ---> 0:06:28.640000
      they'd get no more looks than any other person who happened to step on the subway.
   Segment 88
      0:06:28.640000 ---> 0:06:34.200000
      So that may in fact be true, but think about if an entire subway car or series of subway
   Segment 89
      0:06:34.200000 ---> 0:06:39.600000
      cars were filled with Neanderthals, then that might start getting some different looks.
   Segment 90
      0:06:39.600000 ---> 0:06:45.600000
      So that's the sort of big clue that led genomics researchers to realize that there may actually
   Segment 91
      0:06:45.600000 ---> 0:06:52.520000
      have been some intermixing of genomes after human split from other closely related human-like
   Segment 92
      0:06:52.520000 ---> 0:06:54.200000
      groups.
   Segment 93
      0:06:54.200000 ---> 0:06:59.120000
      So specifically while in most regions of the genome, people are very closely related
   Segment 94
      0:06:59.120000 ---> 0:07:03.240000
      to each other, that is the sequences in their DNA are very, very similar.
   Segment 95
      0:07:03.240000 ---> 0:07:10.040000
      In some regions of the genome, there are stretches of DNA sequence that look weirdly different
   Segment 96
      0:07:10.040000 ---> 0:07:13
      when compared to sequences from other people.
   Segment 97
      0:07:13 ---> 0:07:17.040000
      If that were just a couple of letters like a single Neanderthal on a subway, maybe that
   Segment 98
      0:07:17.040000 ---> 0:07:18.200000
      wouldn't stand out.
   Segment 99
      0:07:18.200000 ---> 0:07:23.520000
      But when those stretches start to get long, they start sticking out like a sore thumb.
   Segment 100
      0:07:23.520000 ---> 0:07:28.120000
      Most of the human genome was sequenced, and researchers started looking in detail at sequences
   Segment 101
      0:07:28.120000 ---> 0:07:32.960000
      from different people and comparing them back to this sort of reference.
   Segment 102
      0:07:32.960000 ---> 0:07:37.440000
      They started finding more and more cases of these kinds of molecular sore thumbs.
   Segment 103
      0:07:37.440000 ---> 0:07:39.760000
      They found that one, they were very common.
   Segment 104
      0:07:39.760000 ---> 0:07:44.720000
      If you looked at the genome of any individual person, these stretches were pretty rare.
   Segment 105
      0:07:44.720000 ---> 0:07:49.080000
      They also found that those sorts of stretches, any single one of them, were really at really
   Segment 106
      0:07:49.080000 ---> 0:07:52.560000
      low frequency in any given population.
   Segment 107
      0:07:52.560000 ---> 0:07:58.320000
      But interestingly, they seemed to be a lot more common in people of European ancestry
   Segment 108
      0:07:58.320000 ---> 0:08:01.960000
      than they were in people of, say, African ancestry.
   Segment 109
      0:08:01.960000 ---> 0:08:07.140000
      And all of those clues together pointed to a potential explanation, interbreeding, recon
   Segment 110
      0:08:07.140000 ---> 0:08:12.400000
      tect of separate branches of the tree, between the ancestors of modern humans in Europe and
   Segment 111
      0:08:12.400000 ---> 0:08:16.920000
      other archaic hominins, when we both still existed on the planet.
   Segment 112
      0:08:16.920000 ---> 0:08:21.520000
      And it specifically suggested contact with the Neanderthals who were an archaic hominin
   Segment 113
      0:08:21.520000 ---> 0:08:25.920000
      group that overlapped with the ancestors of modern Europeans in the Middle East and
   Segment 114
      0:08:25.920000 ---> 0:08:30.160000
      in Europe until about 30 or 40,000 years ago.
   Segment 115
      0:08:30.160000 ---> 0:08:35.720000
      So since then, people working in very advanced, clean labs where they can sequence very, very
   Segment 116
      0:08:35.720000 ---> 0:08:41.120000
      old DNA have actually successfully assembled the entire genomes of some of these archaic
   Segment 117
      0:08:41.120000 ---> 0:08:43.440000
      humans, and they confirm the hypothesis.
   Segment 118
      0:08:43.440000 ---> 0:08:50.080000
      Those weird stretches of DNA look like they match very, very well to Neanderthal DNA.
   Segment 119
      0:08:50.080000 ---> 0:08:56.520000
      Even more, we've been able to discover populations that we didn't know about except through
   Segment 120
      0:08:56.520000 ---> 0:09:02.280000
      ancient DNA evidence, including the elusive Denisovans, which we now knew interbred with
   Segment 121
      0:09:02.280000 ---> 0:09:07.840000
      the ancestors of modern Asians and Oceonian populations.
   Segment 122
      0:09:07.840000 ---> 0:09:13.520000
      We now think, in fact, it's likely that every living human today actually has a mosaic genome
   Segment 123
      0:09:13.520000 ---> 0:09:21.360000
      which carries little stretches of DNA from other archaic hominins that no longer live
   Segment 124
      0:09:21.360000 ---> 0:09:24.320000
      on this Earth.
   Segment 125
      0:09:24.320000 ---> 0:09:32.120000
      These inherited segments may even affect what we look like and where we live today.
   Segment 126
      0:09:32.120000 ---> 0:09:36.720000
      For example, people who can successfully live in very high-altitude environments in the
   Segment 127
      0:09:36.720000 ---> 0:09:41.920000
      Himalayas, like modern Tibetan populations, may be able to do so because they inherited
   Segment 128
      0:09:41.920000 ---> 0:09:48.080000
      a very special chunk of DNA from Denisovans that allow them to persist in really low oxygen
   Segment 129
      0:09:48.080000 ---> 0:09:49.240000
      environments.
   Segment 130
      0:09:49.240000 ---> 0:09:53.880000
      We also have some evidence that chunks of our DNA circulating in modern human populations
   Segment 131
      0:09:53.880000 ---> 0:10:00.280000
      that actually originally came from Neanderthals may help explain why some people are more prone
   Segment 132
      0:10:00.280000 ---> 0:10:05.600000
      to certain types of autoimmune diseases or certain types of mood disorders than others.
   Segment 133
      0:10:05.600000 ---> 0:10:10.280000
      So interestingly, lots of other primates that we study now on Earth also show patterns
   Segment 134
      0:10:10.280000 ---> 0:10:13.160000
      of intermixing after their branches diverge.
   Segment 135
      0:10:13.160000 ---> 0:10:18.320000
      So these new results from humans and from ancient DNA studies actually emphasize the
   Segment 136
      0:10:18.320000 ---> 0:10:24.080000
      continuity between our species, evolutionary history, and the evolutionary processes that
   Segment 137
      0:10:24.080000 ---> 0:10:27.760000
      affect other animals, including our close living relatives.
   Segment 138
      0:10:27.760000 ---> 0:10:33.640000
      So the tree metaphor remains a really powerful one for understanding the evolutionary process.
   Segment 139
      0:10:33.640000 ---> 0:10:37.520000
      The recent research simply emphasizes that not only should we think about the process
   Segment 140
      0:10:37.600000 ---> 0:10:42.760000
      of bifurcation and independent evolution, but also allow for the possibility that sometimes
   Segment 141
      0:10:42.760000 ---> 0:10:47.040000
      those branches start moving in independent directions, but sometimes also re-contact
   Segment 142
      0:10:47.040000 ---> 0:10:49.760000
      each other, at least for a short period of time in evolution.
   Segment 143
      0:10:49.760000 ---> 0:10:54.600000
      And in fact, those processes can be really important in understanding why we are the
   Segment 144
      0:10:54.600000 ---> 0:10:55.600000
      way we are today.

Transcription for Redox Reactions# Crash Course Chemistry #10.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:03.260000
      The electron is to chemistry, what money is to capitalism.
   Segment 2
      0:00:03.260000 ---> 0:00:07.540000
      It's all about who has it, who wants it, and what they're willing to do to get it.
   Segment 3
      0:00:07.540000 ---> 0:00:11.960000
      Electrons are what make it possible for an atom to bond with other atoms to form molecules,
   Segment 4
      0:00:11.960000 ---> 0:00:16.620000
      and when that happens, a tremendous amount of energy can be exchanged in the process.
   Segment 5
      0:00:16.620000 ---> 0:00:21.040000
      But not all chemical reactions involve electrons changing hands, acid-base reactions you'll recall,
   Segment 6
      0:00:21.040000 ---> 0:00:22.640000
      and more about swapping protons.
   Segment 7
      0:00:22.640000 ---> 0:00:24.940000
      But because electrons are the real coin of the realm in chemistry,
   Segment 8
      0:00:24.940000 ---> 0:00:29.860000
      the most important reaction is to take place on Earth and involve the transfer of one or more electrons
   Segment 9
      0:00:29.940000 ---> 0:00:31.400000
      from one atom to another.
   Segment 10
      0:00:31.400000 ---> 0:00:33.900000
      These are redox reactions.
   Segment 11
      0:00:33.900000 ---> 0:00:38.020000
      Redox, which is a portmanteau of reduction oxidation.
   Segment 12
      0:00:47.760000 ---> 0:00:49.160000
      But what's up with those words?
   Segment 13
      0:00:49.160000 ---> 0:00:50.460000
      You know what reduction is?
   Segment 14
      0:00:50.460000 ---> 0:00:54.460000
      Making less of something, and then oxidation maybe has something to do with oxygen?
   Segment 15
      0:00:54.460000 ---> 0:00:57.120000
      Well, sometimes, but not always.
   Segment 16
      0:00:57.140000 ---> 0:01:01.980000
      These are actually super terrible choices for what is actually happening in redox reactions,
   Segment 17
      0:01:01.980000 ---> 0:01:03.460000
      but we are stuck with them.
   Segment 18
      0:01:03.460000 ---> 0:01:07.500000
      Reduction is when a substance gains electrons.
   Segment 19
      0:01:07.500000 ---> 0:01:12.760000
      Yes, it gains, which is the opposite of what the word produce means, fantastic.
   Segment 20
      0:01:12.760000 ---> 0:01:16.260000
      And yes, sometimes I want to punish the people who name these things so inaccurately,
   Segment 21
      0:01:16.260000 ---> 0:01:19.620000
      but they didn't know any better and they're all dead, so we can't do anything about it.
   Segment 22
      0:01:19.620000 ---> 0:01:23.860000
      Protochemists would make pure metals by heating or smelting their ores,
   Segment 23
      0:01:23.880000 ---> 0:01:27.880000
      and they noticed, during the smelting, that these substances would become lighter.
   Segment 24
      0:01:27.880000 ---> 0:01:32.280000
      So I guess it's not crazy that they decided to say that these substances were being reduced.
   Segment 25
      0:01:32.280000 ---> 0:01:36.720000
      Our old French friend Antoine Lavoisier figured out that this was because oxygen gas
   Segment 26
      0:01:36.720000 ---> 0:01:40
      was actually leaving the compound making it lighter.
   Segment 27
      0:01:40 ---> 0:01:42.820000
      What he didn't know was the actual chemistry involved.
   Segment 28
      0:01:42.820000 ---> 0:01:46.440000
      Oxygen is, unsurprisingly, the quintessential oxidizer.
   Segment 29
      0:01:46.440000 ---> 0:01:50.240000
      It pulls electrons off of one molecule to make itself more stable.
   Segment 30
      0:01:50.240000 ---> 0:01:52.520000
      But if you heat it up enough, it gets all energetic.
   Segment 31
      0:01:52.540000 ---> 0:01:56.540000
      Today, we understand that oxidation and reduction are all about electron transfer.
   Segment 32
      0:01:56.540000 ---> 0:01:58.420000
      So you might think that we'd rename them.
   Segment 33
      0:01:58.420000 ---> 0:02:00.780000
      And some chemists have tried, producing terms like
   Segment 34
      0:02:00.780000 ---> 0:02:03.380000
      Electronation and De-electronation,
   Segment 35
      0:02:03.380000 ---> 0:02:06.540000
      but once a set of terms is decided upon and used for a while,
   Segment 36
      0:02:06.540000 ---> 0:02:08.460000
      it's pretty difficult to uncreate it.
   Segment 37
      0:02:08.460000 ---> 0:02:09.540000
      So, we're stuck.
   Segment 38
      0:02:09.540000 ---> 0:02:13.860000
      To keep these seemingly nonsensical names straight, I rely on the phrase,
   Segment 39
      0:02:13.860000 ---> 0:02:14.820000
      Oil Rig.
   Segment 40
      0:02:14.820000 ---> 0:02:17.100000
      Oxidation is loss of electrons.
   Segment 41
      0:02:17.100000 ---> 0:02:19.380000
      Reduction is gain of electrons.
   Segment 42
      0:02:19.380000 ---> 0:02:21.940000
      We just gotta know this stuff, because it's everywhere.
   Segment 43
      0:02:21.940000 ---> 0:02:26.240000
      When your cells convert sugar into energy so you can move and breathe and think,
   Segment 44
      0:02:26.240000 ---> 0:02:27.560000
      that's redox.
   Segment 45
      0:02:27.560000 ---> 0:02:31.640000
      When plants photosynthesize sunlight into food, that's redox.
   Segment 46
      0:02:31.640000 ---> 0:02:33.400000
      The battery powering your laptop?
   Segment 47
      0:02:33.400000 ---> 0:02:34.220000
      Redox.
   Segment 48
      0:02:34.220000 ---> 0:02:35.320000
      Fire?
   Segment 49
      0:02:35.320000 ---> 0:02:36.120000
      Also redox.
   Segment 50
      0:02:36.120000 ---> 0:02:37.960000
      Since electron swapping is the name of the game here,
   Segment 51
      0:02:37.960000 ---> 0:02:40.600000
      when you study redox reactions, it's important.
   Segment 52
      0:02:40.600000 ---> 0:02:45.320000
      Critical, absolutely essential to keep track of the electrons.
   Segment 53
      0:02:45.320000 ---> 0:02:50.080000
      Think of them as dollars or pesos or pounds or euros in any transaction.
   Segment 54
      0:02:50.100000 ---> 0:02:54.100000
      One person is going to gain them and the other is going to lose them.
   Segment 55
      0:02:54.100000 ---> 0:02:58.780000
      And to stay on top of things, you have to keep tabs on who's ahead and who's behind.
   Segment 56
      0:02:58.780000 ---> 0:03:02.540000
      Adams are fond of sharing electrons though, forming covalent bonds,
   Segment 57
      0:03:02.540000 ---> 0:03:07.780000
      so sometimes keeping track of where they are and where they're gonna end up isn't quite so simple.
   Segment 58
      0:03:07.780000 ---> 0:03:10.580000
      Let's think of every covalent compound like a marriage.
   Segment 59
      0:03:10.580000 ---> 0:03:14.980000
      Though it's gonna be a weird marriage, because there might be like six people in it,
   Segment 60
      0:03:14.980000 ---> 0:03:19.260000
      sometimes the same person several times, without commitment, no commitment,
   Segment 61
      0:03:19.440000 ---> 0:03:21.040000
      and also no emotions.
   Segment 62
      0:03:21.040000 ---> 0:03:22.040000
      Don't think too much about it.
   Segment 63
      0:03:22.040000 ---> 0:03:26.600000
      Like in a marriage where money gets shared, covalent compounds share electrons.
   Segment 64
      0:03:26.600000 ---> 0:03:30.240000
      The trick is figuring out who gets the cash when the vows break.
   Segment 65
      0:03:30.240000 ---> 0:03:34
      So we've created a useful little system, assigning electrons 100% to atoms
   Segment 66
      0:03:34 ---> 0:03:36.320000
      that are actually at the moment sharing them.
   Segment 67
      0:03:36.320000 ---> 0:03:40.480000
      The number that we assign is the atom's oxidation state, or oxidation number.
   Segment 68
      0:03:40.480000 ---> 0:03:43.520000
      Even though we are, of course, aware of covalent bonds and the sharing of electrons,
   Segment 69
      0:03:43.520000 ---> 0:03:48.840000
      the processes are easier to follow if we imagine that the atoms are already splitting up the bank account,
   Segment 70
      0:03:48.860000 ---> 0:03:51.340000
      as if they were in an ionic or non-sharing bond.
   Segment 71
      0:03:51.340000 ---> 0:03:54.940000
      So an atom's oxidation number is basically what its charge would be
   Segment 72
      0:03:54.940000 ---> 0:03:57.980000
      if it actually owned all of its electrons exclusively,
   Segment 73
      0:03:57.980000 ---> 0:04:00.420000
      like the newly minted bachelor's that they may become.
   Segment 74
      0:04:00.420000 ---> 0:04:03.060000
      So to figure out those oxidation states, or oxidation numbers,
   Segment 75
      0:04:03.060000 ---> 0:04:05.980000
      we have some simple rules for some atoms.
   Segment 76
      0:04:05.980000 ---> 0:04:09.020000
      First, the oxidation number for any element by itself,
   Segment 77
      0:04:09.020000 ---> 0:04:13.420000
      whether it's monatomic or diatomic or polyatomic, like an atom of calcium,
   Segment 78
      0:04:13.420000 ---> 0:04:17.780000
      or a molecule of H2, or an even bigger molecule of sulfur S8,
   Segment 79
      0:04:17.800000 ---> 0:04:19.640000
      the oxidation number is zero.
   Segment 80
      0:04:19.640000 ---> 0:04:21.740000
      Atoms by definition do not have a charge.
   Segment 81
      0:04:21.740000 ---> 0:04:23.780000
      If they had a charge, they would be ions,
   Segment 82
      0:04:23.780000 ---> 0:04:26.400000
      and if they're sharing with themselves, they share equally.
   Segment 83
      0:04:26.400000 ---> 0:04:29.420000
      Second, for a monatomic ion, basically a charged atom,
   Segment 84
      0:04:29.420000 ---> 0:04:32
      it's simply the size or number of its charge.
   Segment 85
      0:04:32 ---> 0:04:36.140000
      So the iron 2 and Fe2+, has an oxidation state of plus 2,
   Segment 86
      0:04:36.140000 ---> 0:04:38.080000
      while a chloride ion is minus 1.
   Segment 87
      0:04:38.080000 ---> 0:04:41.640000
      Third, oxygen, which is unsurprisingly all over redox chemistry,
   Segment 88
      0:04:41.640000 ---> 0:04:44.440000
      almost always has an oxidation of negative 2,
   Segment 89
      0:04:44.460000 ---> 0:04:47.980000
      unless it happens to be in a peroxide molecule like hydrogen peroxide.
   Segment 90
      0:04:47.980000 ---> 0:04:52.860000
      Fourth, hydrogen is plus 1, and fifth, fluorine is negative 1,
   Segment 91
      0:04:52.860000 ---> 0:04:55.880000
      as are all the other halogens most of the time.
   Segment 92
      0:04:55.880000 ---> 0:04:58.480000
      Pretty much unless they're bonded to fluorine or oxygen,
   Segment 93
      0:04:58.480000 ---> 0:05:02.580000
      because fluorine and oxygen are so bad that they can make anybody's oxidation number positive,
   Segment 94
      0:05:02.580000 ---> 0:05:03.620000
      if you know what I mean.
   Segment 95
      0:05:03.620000 ---> 0:05:05.860000
      And those are the rules! That's all you need to know.
   Segment 96
      0:05:05.860000 ---> 0:05:10.740000
      Now, the total of all the oxidation numbers of all the atoms in a neutral compound
   Segment 97
      0:05:10.740000 ---> 0:05:14.360000
      will add up to zero, like water with one oxygen,
   Segment 98
      0:05:14.360000 ---> 0:05:19.080000
      with a negative 2 oxidation state, and two hydrogens at plus 1, and voila!
   Segment 99
      0:05:19.080000 ---> 0:05:21.840000
      The neutral compound has an oxidation number of zero.
   Segment 100
      0:05:21.840000 ---> 0:05:26.960000
      A polyatomic ion, on the other hand, has to work out to have an oxidation state that matches its charge.
   Segment 101
      0:05:26.960000 ---> 0:05:32.040000
      So SO42 minus the sulfate ion, has 4 oxygens for a total of negative 8,
   Segment 102
      0:05:32.040000 ---> 0:05:36.080000
      but we don't have a rule for sulfur, so I guess we just give up and walk away.
   Segment 103
      0:05:36.080000 ---> 0:05:37.120000
      Who cares anymore?
   Segment 104
      0:05:37.140000 ---> 0:05:43.780000
      No! We use like third-grade algebra, because we have to end up with an oxidation number of negative 2 for the whole compound.
   Segment 105
      0:05:43.780000 ---> 0:05:48.540000
      We know that sulfur, in this particular compound, has an oxidation state of plus 6.
   Segment 106
      0:05:48.540000 ---> 0:05:53.460000
      But sulfur's oxidation state isn't always plus 6, and that's why we don't have a rule for sulfur,
   Segment 107
      0:05:53.460000 ---> 0:05:59.560000
      or a lot of other elements for that matter, because oxidation states of most elements change depending on what they're bonded with.
   Segment 108
      0:05:59.560000 ---> 0:06:05.540000
      Now we can use this same logic to figure out what happens when these compounds interact in redox reactions.
   Segment 109
      0:06:05.560000 ---> 0:06:12.680000
      Molecular divorce courts of electrons changing hands being haggled over and treated with some players taking big profits,
   Segment 110
      0:06:12.680000 ---> 0:06:14.920000
      while others lose nearly everything.
   Segment 111
      0:06:14.920000 ---> 0:06:15.840000
      That ends the breaks.
   Segment 112
      0:06:15.840000 ---> 0:06:17.400000
      Let's start out with a simple example.
   Segment 113
      0:06:17.400000 ---> 0:06:23.080000
      A chemical reaction that I believe has saved more lives than any other in the history of chemistry,
   Segment 114
      0:06:23.080000 ---> 0:06:28.200000
      created by a war criminal to blow people up during World War I, the Haber process.
   Segment 115
      0:06:28.200000 ---> 0:06:32.280000
      The Haber process removes the ultra-stable elemental nitrogen from the air,
   Segment 116
      0:06:32.280000 ---> 0:06:35.300000
      and combines it with hydrogen to form NH3,
   Segment 117
      0:06:35.320000 ---> 0:06:42.560000
      ammonia for use in bombs, and also in fertilizer, increasing the carrying capacity of the Earth by billions.
   Segment 118
      0:06:42.560000 ---> 0:06:49
      Nitrogen in the air exists as elemental diatomic nitrogen, and hydrogen likewise is also diatomic H2.
   Segment 119
      0:06:49 ---> 0:06:53.280000
      So we know that starting out all of the atoms have an oxidation state of zero.
   Segment 120
      0:06:53.280000 ---> 0:06:57.640000
      The product of the reaction ammonia is a neutral compound with one nitrogen and three hydrogens.
   Segment 121
      0:06:57.640000 ---> 0:07:01.400000
      The hydrogens each have an oxidation state of plus 1. Remember the rules.
   Segment 122
      0:07:01.400000 ---> 0:07:04.320000
      So nitrogen must have an oxidation state of minus 3.
   Segment 123
      0:07:04.340000 ---> 0:07:09.660000
      Nitrogen thus gained electrons, its oxidation state went down, and so it was reduced.
   Segment 124
      0:07:09.660000 ---> 0:07:14.300000
      So at least we're talking about what oxidation states are doing, the word reduced makes sense.
   Segment 125
      0:07:14.300000 ---> 0:07:18.380000
      Hydrogen lost electrons, the oxidation state went up, and it was oxidized.
   Segment 126
      0:07:18.380000 ---> 0:07:23.820000
      Now this is a pretty simple equation to balance, but redox equations can be a huge headache sometimes
   Segment 127
      0:07:23.820000 ---> 0:07:26.620000
      because of the number of individual atoms involved.
   Segment 128
      0:07:26.620000 ---> 0:07:29.300000
      So we often have to balance them in half reactions.
   Segment 129
      0:07:29.300000 ---> 0:07:32.660000
      So even though we don't really need to do the half reactions, because this is a pretty simple equation,
   Segment 130
      0:07:32.680000 ---> 0:07:36.840000
      we're going to do them anyway, just because it's an example that's simple to start with.
   Segment 131
      0:07:36.840000 ---> 0:07:39.160000
      So start out with the nitrogen getting reduced.
   Segment 132
      0:07:39.160000 ---> 0:07:44.700000
      We have N2 with an oxidation state of zero becoming NH3 with an oxidation state of negative 3.
   Segment 133
      0:07:44.700000 ---> 0:07:48.780000
      First we balance the number of nitrogens, then add the number of electrons that we need to have
   Segment 134
      0:07:48.780000 ---> 0:07:51.240000
      to have there to be the same number of electrons on each side.
   Segment 135
      0:07:51.240000 ---> 0:07:55.360000
      Do the same with the oxidation half of the reaction, and then combine them to get your whole reaction
   Segment 136
      0:07:55.360000 ---> 0:07:56.880000
      with the electrons canceling out.
   Segment 137
      0:07:56.880000 ---> 0:08:00.880000
      Now you ask maybe that seemed like an unnecessary step, but allow me to show you a more complicated
   Segment 138
      0:08:00.900000 ---> 0:08:03.700000
      example that will prove how necessary it may be.
   Segment 139
      0:08:03.700000 ---> 0:08:06.460000
      In this flask is silver diamine.
   Segment 140
      0:08:06.460000 ---> 0:08:10.500000
      We're going to use some redox chemistry to get the elemental silver out of it nice and
   Segment 141
      0:08:10.500000 ---> 0:08:14.380000
      clean and shiny, and it's not going to be no simple harbor process.
   Segment 142
      0:08:14.380000 ---> 0:08:19.340000
      The silver diamine is going to react with an organic aldehyde, any aldehyde actually.
   Segment 143
      0:08:19.340000 ---> 0:08:22.060000
      The business end of the aldehyde is the CHO end.
   Segment 144
      0:08:22.060000 ---> 0:08:26.820000
      The R in organic chemistry is a symbol for some organic group of atoms, and in this reaction
   Segment 145
      0:08:26.820000 ---> 0:08:28.060000
      those atoms don't matter.
   Segment 146
      0:08:28.080000 ---> 0:08:33.320000
      The silver diamine reacts with the aldehyde and hydroxide, creating carboxylic acid, ammonia,
   Segment 147
      0:08:33.320000 ---> 0:08:34.320000
      and water.
   Segment 148
      0:08:34.320000 ---> 0:08:36.320000
      First let's assign ourselves some oxidation states.
   Segment 149
      0:08:36.320000 ---> 0:08:40.980000
      The silver is in a complex with two neutral ammonia's that are going to remain unreacted
   Segment 150
      0:08:40.980000 ---> 0:08:45.360000
      throughout the equation, so we can treat them like a single species with an oxidation state
   Segment 151
      0:08:45.360000 ---> 0:08:46.560000
      of zero.
   Segment 152
      0:08:46.560000 ---> 0:08:50.680000
      Since the silver diamine has a charge of plus one, and the ammonia's don't affect that
   Segment 153
      0:08:50.680000 ---> 0:08:53.880000
      silver's oxidation state must also be plus one.
   Segment 154
      0:08:53.900000 ---> 0:08:59.060000
      The aldehyde has one hydrogen at plus one and one oxygen at minus two, but is neutral
   Segment 155
      0:08:59.060000 ---> 0:09:02.540000
      overall so the carbon must be plus one as well.
   Segment 156
      0:09:02.540000 ---> 0:09:07.220000
      The hydroxide ion is simple, minus two for the oxygen, plus one for the hydrogen, and
   Segment 157
      0:09:07.220000 ---> 0:09:10.240000
      an overall charge in the oxidation state of minus one.
   Segment 158
      0:09:10.240000 ---> 0:09:14.500000
      On the reactant side, the silver is now atomic, so its oxidation state is zero.
   Segment 159
      0:09:14.500000 ---> 0:09:19.260000
      The carboxylic acid has two oxygens and one hydrogen, so the carbon now has an oxidation
   Segment 160
      0:09:19.260000 ---> 0:09:24.260000
      state of plus three, NH3 remains at zero and the hydrogen and oxygen of water also
   Segment 161
      0:09:24.260000 ---> 0:09:26.140000
      haven't changed oxidation states.
   Segment 162
      0:09:26.140000 ---> 0:09:30.640000
      So silver's oxidation state decreased or was reduced from plus one to zero, while
   Segment 163
      0:09:30.640000 ---> 0:09:33.520000
      carbon was oxidized from plus one to plus three.
   Segment 164
      0:09:33.520000 ---> 0:09:34.920000
      Half reaction time!
   Segment 165
      0:09:34.920000 ---> 0:09:39.060000
      Silver was reduced, gaining one electron, forming elemental silver and ammonia from
   Segment 166
      0:09:39.060000 ---> 0:09:40.060000
      silver diamine.
   Segment 167
      0:09:40.060000 ---> 0:09:44.300000
      The aldehyde was oxidized, forming carboxylic acid and requiring two electrons.
   Segment 168
      0:09:44.300000 ---> 0:09:47.800000
      But to help with those electrons, we know that at the very least we have to double the
   Segment 169
      0:09:47.840000 ---> 0:09:52.240000
      reduction half of the equation entirely in order to get the right number of electrons
   Segment 170
      0:09:52.240000 ---> 0:09:53.240000
      on both sides.
   Segment 171
      0:09:53.240000 ---> 0:09:56.260000
      We do that and oh god, that's good stuff.
   Segment 172
      0:09:56.260000 ---> 0:09:59.920000
      And we combine them together for a perfectly balanced redox equation.
   Segment 173
      0:09:59.920000 ---> 0:10:03.760000
      And now watch me dig those electrons and turn them into money.
   Segment 174
      0:10:03.760000 ---> 0:10:08.160000
      And there you have it folks, that is pure silver coating the inside of the flask.
   Segment 175
      0:10:08.160000 ---> 0:10:10.620000
      Thank you for watching this episode of Crash Course Chemistry.
   Segment 176
      0:10:10.620000 ---> 0:10:14.840000
      If you were paying attention, you learned that any reaction where electrons move around
   Segment 177
      0:10:14.840000 ---> 0:10:17.280000
      from atom to atom is a redox reaction.
   Segment 178
      0:10:17.280000 ---> 0:10:22.240000
      That oxidation is the laws of electrons and that reduction is the gain of electrons and
   Segment 179
      0:10:22.240000 ---> 0:10:26
      that oxidation numbers are assigned to add them to take part in reactions in order to
   Segment 180
      0:10:26 ---> 0:10:28.040000
      keep track of what their electrons are up to.
   Segment 181
      0:10:28.040000 ---> 0:10:31.920000
      You also learned a few simple tricks to help figure out what an atom's oxidation state
   Segment 182
      0:10:31.920000 ---> 0:10:36.080000
      is and you got a little practice figuring out how to assign oxidation states and balance
   Segment 183
      0:10:36.080000 ---> 0:10:40.920000
      oxidation reactions with two examples, one pretty simple and another a little less so.
   Segment 184
      0:10:40.920000 ---> 0:10:44.560000
      This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was written by Kim Krieger and myself, our script

   Segment 186
      0:10:49.160000 ---> 0:10:52.880000
      And a troop of chemistry teachers also advised and edited this one, so thanks very much to
   Segment 187

Transcription for The Day the Mesozoic Died# The Asteroid That Killed the Dinosaurs — HHMI BioInteractive Video.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:25.520000
      picture a world of giant reptiles flying
   Segment 2
      0:00:25.520000 ---> 0:00:29.760000
      pterosaurs with 40 foot wingspans.
   Segment 3
      0:00:29.760000 ---> 0:00:33.120000
      While beneath the waves, fierce predators called
   Segment 4
      0:00:33.120000 ---> 0:00:35.760000
      Mosesores prowled the seas.
   Segment 5
      0:00:35.760000 ---> 0:00:41.160000
      And dinosaurs roamed the land.
   Segment 6
      0:00:41.160000 ---> 0:00:44.860000
      For more than a hundred million years,
   Segment 7
      0:00:44.860000 ---> 0:00:49.600000
      creatures like these ruled the planet.
   Segment 8
      0:00:49.600000 ---> 0:00:55.480000
      And then they were gone, lost in the shadows of time.
   Segment 9
      0:00:55.840000 ---> 0:00:59.240000
      Their extinction, a mystery for the ages.
   Segment 10
      0:01:08.680000 ---> 0:01:12.520000
      This is all we have left of those magnificent creatures,
   Segment 11
      0:01:12.520000 ---> 0:01:15.360000
      bones, and a lot of them.
   Segment 12
      0:01:15.360000 ---> 0:01:17.520000
      We've collected enormous numbers of bones,
   Segment 13
      0:01:17.520000 ---> 0:01:20
      and from them we can tell how these creatures lived,
   Segment 14
      0:01:20 ---> 0:01:23
      what they looked like, when they lived.
   Segment 15
      0:01:23 ---> 0:01:25.800000
      But we don't know why they disappeared.
   Segment 16
      0:01:25.800000 ---> 0:01:28.040000
      To solve that mystery required some of the greatest
   Segment 17
      0:01:28.040000 ---> 0:01:30.200000
      scientific detective work ever.
   Segment 18
      0:01:30.200000 ---> 0:01:33.200000
      And the trail began almost halfway around the world from here.
   Segment 19
      0:01:36.240000 ---> 0:01:41.480000
      This is Gubio, a sleepy Italian town.
   Segment 20
      0:01:41.480000 ---> 0:01:43.840000
      Not a single giant reptile in sight.
   Segment 21
      0:01:46.760000 ---> 0:01:50.720000
      Still, the past is everywhere you look.
   Segment 22
      0:01:50.720000 ---> 0:01:54.640000
      In the medieval palaces and churches,
   Segment 23
      0:01:54.640000 ---> 0:01:59.560000
      the homes and narrow streets, while an even deeper past lies
   Segment 24
      0:01:59.560000 ---> 0:02:00.080000
      nearby.
   Segment 25
      0:02:06.120000 ---> 0:02:09.280000
      Just outside of Gubio, Alessandro Montanari
   Segment 26
      0:02:09.280000 ---> 0:02:10.800000
      is looking for that distant past.
   Segment 27
      0:02:14.920000 ---> 0:02:17.880000
      He's a time traveler moving towards the lost world
   Segment 28
      0:02:17.880000 ---> 0:02:20.440000
      of the dinosaurs.
   Segment 29
      0:02:20.440000 ---> 0:02:23.600000
      It's ancient history written in these limestone cliffs.
   Segment 30
      0:02:29.080000 ---> 0:02:31.560000
      Millions of years ago, these mountains
   Segment 31
      0:02:31.560000 ---> 0:02:34.880000
      were at the bottom of a deep sea,
   Segment 32
      0:02:34.880000 ---> 0:02:38.320000
      collecting layers of sediments and depositors
   Segment 33
      0:02:38.320000 ---> 0:02:41.440000
      slowly through time, and eventually pushed
   Segment 34
      0:02:41.440000 ---> 0:02:46.520000
      by tatonic forces folded and uplifted.
   Segment 35
      0:02:46.520000 ---> 0:02:50.320000
      So all of this rock and all of these layers
   Segment 36
      0:02:50.320000 ---> 0:02:52.080000
      were once at the bottom of the ocean.
   Segment 37
      0:02:52.080000 ---> 0:02:52.880000
      Exactly.
   Segment 38
      0:02:52.880000 ---> 0:02:56.120000
      And then all these other forces have brought this old rock up
   Segment 39
      0:02:56.120000 ---> 0:02:56.680000
      to you.
   Segment 40
      0:02:56.680000 ---> 0:02:59.840000
      Yes, that we can actually study layer by layer,
   Segment 41
      0:02:59.840000 ---> 0:03:02.560000
      like pages of a book, The History of the Earth.
   Segment 42
      0:03:07.920000 ---> 0:03:11.960000
      Gubio's deep sea limestone, now exposed by the side of the road,
   Segment 43
      0:03:11.960000 ---> 0:03:15.600000
      became a magnet for scientists.
   Segment 44
      0:03:15.600000 ---> 0:03:18.840000
      Especially this site that may seem ordinary,
   Segment 45
      0:03:18.840000 ---> 0:03:20.640000
      but holds one of the strangest features
   Segment 46
      0:03:20.640000 ---> 0:03:25.920000
      to confront the geologist, a thin layer of dark clay.
   Segment 47
      0:03:30.120000 ---> 0:03:33.320000
      In the 1970s, the clay captured the attention
   Segment 48
      0:03:33.320000 ---> 0:03:35.960000
      of an American geologist, Walter Alvarez.
   Segment 49
      0:03:39.240000 ---> 0:03:41.240000
      He was trying to determine the relative ages
   Segment 50
      0:03:41.240000 ---> 0:03:43.720000
      of the limestone layers by analyzing
   Segment 51
      0:03:43.720000 ---> 0:03:48.640000
      the fossils left by tiny, shelled sea creatures.
   Segment 52
      0:03:48.640000 ---> 0:03:52.080000
      Called foraminifera, or forams for short,
   Segment 53
      0:03:52.080000 ---> 0:03:55.440000
      they're among the most common ocean plankton.
   Segment 54
      0:03:55.440000 ---> 0:03:57.800000
      When they die, their shells become part of the sediment.
   Segment 55
      0:04:00.680000 ---> 0:04:03.640000
      Since many different species have evolved over the ages,
   Segment 56
      0:04:03.640000 ---> 0:04:05.760000
      they can serve as markers of geologic time.
   Segment 57
      0:04:08.760000 ---> 0:04:11.680000
      But as Alvarez studied them, he noticed something striking.
   Segment 58
      0:04:14.360000 ---> 0:04:16.960000
      Well, what he sees, and it was puzzled by,
   Segment 59
      0:04:17 ---> 0:04:19.640000
      after the very top of that white layer,
   Segment 60
      0:04:19.640000 ---> 0:04:24.640000
      hold his very diverse microfossils species
   Segment 61
      0:04:24.640000 ---> 0:04:26.440000
      would disappear.
   Segment 62
      0:04:26.440000 ---> 0:04:27.840000
      OK.
   Segment 63
      0:04:27.840000 ---> 0:04:30.800000
      So, Sandra, when Walter Alvarez looked in these rocks,
   Segment 64
      0:04:30.800000 ---> 0:04:33.040000
      he saw all these species of forearms.
   Segment 65
      0:04:33.040000 ---> 0:04:36.200000
      They're plentiful, there are many species for thousands
   Segment 66
      0:04:36.200000 ---> 0:04:38.680000
      and thousands and thousands of years.
   Segment 67
      0:04:38.680000 ---> 0:04:41.120000
      But after this little scene of clay here,
   Segment 68
      0:04:41.120000 ---> 0:04:43.640000
      all the way up through these rock layers,
   Segment 69
      0:04:43.640000 ---> 0:04:45.480000
      those forearms are missing.
   Segment 70
      0:04:45.480000 ---> 0:04:46.840000
      Those pieces are gone.
   Segment 71
      0:04:46.840000 ---> 0:04:48.040000
      Disappeared.
   Segment 72
      0:04:48.040000 ---> 0:04:48.600000
      Disappeared.
   Segment 73
      0:04:48.600000 ---> 0:04:50.560000
      And that's a fundamental mystery.
   Segment 74
      0:04:50.560000 ---> 0:04:53.160000
      What would make these little creatures disappear?
   Segment 75
      0:04:53.160000 ---> 0:04:54.960000
      Yes.
   Segment 76
      0:04:54.960000 ---> 0:04:56.840000
      So Alvarez was stumped.
   Segment 77
      0:04:56.840000 ---> 0:04:59.440000
      What did this thin line of clay represent?
   Segment 78
      0:04:59.440000 ---> 0:05:02.400000
      It was laid down 65 million years ago,
   Segment 79
      0:05:02.400000 ---> 0:05:05.240000
      the same time when the dinosaurs disappeared.
   Segment 80
      0:05:05.240000 ---> 0:05:08.040000
      Was there any link?
   Segment 81
      0:05:08.040000 ---> 0:05:09.760000
      The same questions were being asked
   Segment 82
      0:05:09.760000 ---> 0:05:12.560000
      1,500 kilometers away in Spain.
   Segment 83
      0:05:16.480000 ---> 0:05:20.480000
      On the Atlantic coast, outside the town of Zumaya,
   Segment 84
      0:05:20.480000 ---> 0:05:23.480000
      Dutch geologist Jan Smit was studying the forearms
   Segment 85
      0:05:23.480000 ---> 0:05:25.480000
      from a different ancient sea.
   Segment 86
      0:05:29.480000 ---> 0:05:32.480000
      Their fossilized shells formed these limestone rocks,
   Segment 87
      0:05:32.480000 ---> 0:05:36.480000
      which like Gubio's mountains, were once at the bottom of the ocean.
   Segment 88
      0:05:36.480000 ---> 0:05:39.480000
      20,000 years ago,
   Segment 89
      0:05:39.480000 ---> 0:05:43.480000
      now exposed they represent over a million years
   Segment 90
      0:05:43.480000 ---> 0:05:47.480000
      of a geological time period known as the Cretaceous.
   Segment 91
      0:05:50.480000 ---> 0:05:51.480000
      Like Alvarez in Italy,
   Segment 92
      0:05:51.480000 ---> 0:05:54.480000
      Smit had also found a strange clay layer
   Segment 93
      0:05:54.480000 ---> 0:05:56.480000
      formed at the same time,
   Segment 94
      0:05:56.480000 ---> 0:05:59.480000
      which told a dramatic story.
   Segment 95
      0:06:03.480000 ---> 0:06:06.480000
      Jan, what can we tell about Earth's history
   Segment 96
      0:06:06.480000 ---> 0:06:08.480000
      from just looking at these rocks?
   Segment 97
      0:06:08.480000 ---> 0:06:11.480000
      Well, you can see at the end of the one world
   Segment 98
      0:06:11.480000 ---> 0:06:13.480000
      and the beginning of the next one.
   Segment 99
      0:06:13.480000 ---> 0:06:16.480000
      You see there is a very sharp,
   Segment 100
      0:06:16.480000 ---> 0:06:19.480000
      extremely sharp dividing line between the two.
   Segment 101
      0:06:19.480000 ---> 0:06:20.480000
      That gray band?
   Segment 102
      0:06:20.480000 ---> 0:06:21.480000
      That's that gray band over there.
   Segment 103
      0:06:21.480000 ---> 0:06:24.480000
      At the bottom of that gray band, you see it's razor sharp.
   Segment 104
      0:06:25.480000 ---> 0:06:27.480000
      In this reddish maroon rock,
   Segment 105
      0:06:27.480000 ---> 0:06:29.480000
      the oceans are healthy and steaming.
   Segment 106
      0:06:29.480000 ---> 0:06:32.480000
      They're healthy, they're steady, they don't change at all.
   Segment 107
      0:06:32.480000 ---> 0:06:35.480000
      And all of a sudden we see dramatic change,
   Segment 108
      0:06:35.480000 ---> 0:06:37.480000
      which we call the Katie Boundary.
   Segment 109
      0:06:37.480000 ---> 0:06:42.480000
      The Katie Boundary found at the bottom of this gray layer
   Segment 110
      0:06:42.480000 ---> 0:06:46.480000
      marks not only the end of a period, the Cretaceous,
   Segment 111
      0:06:46.480000 ---> 0:06:48.480000
      but also of the Mesozoic era,
   Segment 112
      0:06:48.480000 ---> 0:06:51.480000
      a much longer stretch of time.
   Segment 113
      0:06:51.480000 ---> 0:06:55.480000
      The history of animal life on Earth has been divided
   Segment 114
      0:06:55.480000 ---> 0:06:57.480000
      into three such eras.
   Segment 115
      0:06:57.480000 ---> 0:07:00.480000
      Early life, or Paleozoic,
   Segment 116
      0:07:00.480000 ---> 0:07:05.480000
      the Age of Dinosaurs, or Mesozoic,
   Segment 117
      0:07:06.480000 ---> 0:07:09.480000
      and the Era of Mammals, or Cenozoic.
   Segment 118
      0:07:11.480000 ---> 0:07:16.480000
      The Cretaceous tertiary boundary lies right in between these two eras,
   Segment 119
      0:07:18.480000 ---> 0:07:21.480000
      marked here by this layer of clay.
   Segment 120
      0:07:25.480000 ---> 0:07:27.480000
      What drew you to this boundary, Jan?
   Segment 121
      0:07:27.480000 ---> 0:07:31.480000
      Well, Sean, we're looking here at the very topmost rocks of the Cretaceous.
   Segment 122
      0:07:31.480000 ---> 0:07:34.480000
      These rocks are literally packed with foreign minifra.
   Segment 123
      0:07:34.480000 ---> 0:07:39.480000
      So we call this the Cretaceous, and these rocks here are the tertiary.
   Segment 124
      0:07:39.480000 ---> 0:07:43.480000
      And the base of the tertiary consists of a dark gray clay layer,
   Segment 125
      0:07:43.480000 ---> 0:07:46.480000
      and there the life has almost disappeared.
   Segment 126
      0:07:46.480000 ---> 0:07:48.480000
      And the Katie Boundary is just in between.
   Segment 127
      0:07:48.480000 ---> 0:07:53.480000
      I can point at it, it's right here where you see a contrast between the purple
   Segment 128
      0:07:53.480000 ---> 0:07:55.480000
      and the dark.
   Segment 129
      0:07:55.480000 ---> 0:07:57.480000
      It's an extremely sharp boundary.
   Segment 130
      0:07:57.480000 ---> 0:08:00.480000
      And just across that thin little boundary,
   Segment 131
      0:08:00.480000 ---> 0:08:03.480000
      there's this huge change in what you see in the forearms.
   Segment 132
      0:08:03.480000 ---> 0:08:05.480000
      And why is that so stunning to you?
   Segment 133
      0:08:05.480000 ---> 0:08:09.480000
      It's so stunning because there is no preceding evidence of anything happening there.
   Segment 134
      0:08:09.480000 ---> 0:08:12.480000
      So it doesn't matter if I take a piece here, a piece there,
   Segment 135
      0:08:12.480000 ---> 0:08:15.480000
      or just underneath what we call the Katie Boundary.
   Segment 136
      0:08:15.480000 ---> 0:08:19.480000
      The foremanifera will remain the same, so they don't change overnight.
   Segment 137
      0:08:19.480000 ---> 0:08:21.480000
      And then bang, they're gone.
   Segment 138
      0:08:21.480000 ---> 0:08:22.480000
      So what's that telly?
   Segment 139
      0:08:22.480000 ---> 0:08:25.480000
      It tells me the base of the foot chain of the oceans disappeared.
   Segment 140
      0:08:25.480000 ---> 0:08:30.480000
      And everything which is dependent on it is totally zapped right at the boundary.
   Segment 141
      0:08:34.480000 ---> 0:08:41.480000
      In Amsterdam, the change at the boundary becomes clearer
   Segment 142
      0:08:41.480000 ---> 0:08:44.480000
      when Smith takes a closer look at the evidence.
   Segment 143
      0:08:47.480000 ---> 0:08:51.480000
      In his lab, he analyzes four amps extracted from the limestone.
   Segment 144
      0:08:53.480000 ---> 0:08:58.480000
      Under the microscope, the rich diversity of fossilized shells from the Cretaceous
   Segment 145
      0:08:58.480000 ---> 0:09:00.480000
      snaps into focus.
   Segment 146
      0:09:01.480000 ---> 0:09:05.480000
      Some four dozen species appear below the boundary.
   Segment 147
      0:09:08.480000 ---> 0:09:10.480000
      But above it, there's a different world.
   Segment 148
      0:09:14.480000 ---> 0:09:18.480000
      These are the foremanifera from just below the boundary.
   Segment 149
      0:09:19.480000 ---> 0:09:23.480000
      And these are from just above the boundary.
   Segment 150
      0:09:25.480000 ---> 0:09:28.480000
      Only a few species have survived into the tertiary.
   Segment 151
      0:09:29.480000 ---> 0:09:31.480000
      And they're much smaller.
   Segment 152
      0:09:32.480000 ---> 0:09:36.480000
      As soon as you see that extinction, and you realize at the same time
   Segment 153
      0:09:36.480000 ---> 0:09:39.480000
      that the dinosaurs are disappearing, you know you're looking at something very important.
   Segment 154
      0:09:40.480000 ---> 0:09:42.480000
      But you see it and nobody has witnessed it.
   Segment 155
      0:09:42.480000 ---> 0:09:45.480000
      So we're looking for silent witnesses in the rock,
   Segment 156
      0:09:45.480000 ---> 0:09:48.480000
      and the first thing that comes to mind is this beautiful play layer.
   Segment 157
      0:09:50.480000 ---> 0:09:54.480000
      A layer varying in color and thickness, and found around the world.
   Segment 158
      0:09:55.480000 ---> 0:10:00.480000
      Walter Alvarez also believed it was a silent witness to the end of an era.
   Segment 159
      0:10:02.480000 ---> 0:10:08.480000
      The key question was, how long did it take to form for the world to change?
   Segment 160
      0:10:10.480000 ---> 0:10:14.480000
      To find out, he sought help at the University of California at Berkeley
   Segment 161
      0:10:14.480000 ---> 0:10:17.480000
      from a Nobel Prize-winning physicist.
   Segment 162
      0:10:18.480000 ---> 0:10:22.480000
      Someone he knew pretty well, his father, Louis Alvarez.
   Segment 163
      0:10:25.480000 ---> 0:10:29.480000
      Louis loved a good mystery, no matter what field it was in.
   Segment 164
      0:10:31.480000 ---> 0:10:36.480000
      And that's how physics joined geology in the quest to explain the KT extinction.
   Segment 165
      0:10:39.480000 ---> 0:10:44.480000
      Alvarez looked at this layer, tried to figure out how you could determine the time scale.
   Segment 166
      0:10:45.480000 ---> 0:10:49.480000
      He brought in his knowledge of astrophysics, his knowledge of nuclear physics,
   Segment 167
      0:10:50.480000 ---> 0:10:55.480000
      and realized that there's an element that's relatively rare in the crust of the earth
   Segment 168
      0:10:55.480000 ---> 0:10:57.480000
      that occurs in meteorites.
   Segment 169
      0:10:59.480000 ---> 0:11:04.480000
      The element was iridium, which falls steadily in an invisible rain of cosmic space dust.
   Segment 170
      0:11:09.480000 ---> 0:11:11.480000
      If the layer had taken thousands of years to form,
   Segment 171
      0:11:12.480000 ---> 0:11:15.480000
      Alvarez thought there might be just enough iridium to measure.
   Segment 172
      0:11:16.480000 ---> 0:11:22.480000
      But when the clay was tested, the scientists were stunned to find it contained 30 times more iridium
   Segment 173
      0:11:23.480000 ---> 0:11:24.480000
      than the surrounding rock.
   Segment 174
      0:11:26.480000 ---> 0:11:30.480000
      Moreover, samples from other KT sites had similar levels,
   Segment 175
      0:11:31.480000 ---> 0:11:33.480000
      too much to come from ordinary space dust.
   Segment 176
      0:11:35.480000 ---> 0:11:39.480000
      What could explain so much iridium deposited around the world?
   Segment 177
      0:11:40.480000 ---> 0:11:44.480000
      Perhaps catastrophic event in outer space.
   Segment 178
      0:11:45.480000 ---> 0:11:50.480000
      Alvarez wondered if a supernova exploding nearby might be responsible.
   Segment 179
      0:11:53.480000 ---> 0:11:59.480000
      So he asked me if that was possible, and I concluded that there was only one chance in a billion
   Segment 180
      0:12:00.480000 ---> 0:12:04.480000
      that such a supernova would occur that close in 100 million years.
   Segment 181
      0:12:05.480000 ---> 0:12:11.480000
      A supernova would have also deposited a rare isotope, plutonium-244.
   Segment 182
      0:12:12.480000 ---> 0:12:14.480000
      But testing revealed there wasn't any.
   Segment 183
      0:12:16.480000 ---> 0:12:21.480000
      Well, I suggest it alternatively that it could have been an asteroid or a comet.
   Segment 184
      0:12:23.480000 ---> 0:12:26.480000
      There are hundreds of asteroids whose pass across the Earth's orbit.
   Segment 185
      0:12:27.480000 ---> 0:12:31.480000
      Their sizes range from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers across.
   Segment 186
      0:12:34.480000 ---> 0:12:41.480000
      So, Louis Alvarez had this hypothesis that an asteroid or comet would cause this destruction.
   Segment 187
      0:12:42.480000 ---> 0:12:45.480000
      He had the clue, the amount of iridium at Gubio.
   Segment 188
      0:12:46.480000 ---> 0:12:48.480000
      Under this hypothesis, it would be spread all around the world.
   Segment 189
      0:12:49.480000 ---> 0:12:54.480000
      So now he could calculate how much iridium there had been laid down over the Earth's orbit.
   Segment 190
      0:12:56.480000 ---> 0:12:59.480000
      He could calculate the size of the object.
   Segment 191
      0:13:02.480000 ---> 0:13:04.480000
      The answer was sobering.
   Segment 192
      0:13:05.480000 ---> 0:13:10.480000
      An asteroid 10 kilometers in diameter, as large as Mount Everest,
   Segment 193
      0:13:11.480000 ---> 0:13:14.480000
      and weighing hundreds of billions of tons.
   Segment 194
      0:13:17.480000 ---> 0:13:21.480000
      Still, how could something that size wreak havoc on a large planet?
   Segment 195
      0:13:26.480000 ---> 0:13:33.480000
      Because traveling through the vacuum of space, it would have slammed into the Earth's atmosphere at 80,000 kilometers per hour.
   Segment 196
      0:13:34.480000 ---> 0:13:39.480000
      20 times faster than a bullet, heating the air to several times the temperature of the sun.
   Segment 197
      0:13:42.480000 ---> 0:13:50.480000
      At impact, the energy released would be equal to about 100 million nuclear bombs exploding at once.
   Segment 198
      0:13:51.480000 ---> 0:14:00.480000
      A huge mass of pulverized debris would have been blasted into space, some of it orbiting the Earth before raining back down.
   Segment 199
      0:14:03.480000 ---> 0:14:06.480000
      The debris may have blocked out the sun for months.
   Segment 200
      0:14:07.480000 ---> 0:14:09.480000
      Photosynthesis would have stopped.
   Segment 201
      0:14:10.480000 ---> 0:14:14.480000
      Plants, plant eaters, and then meat eaters would have died.
   Segment 202
      0:14:15.480000 ---> 0:14:20.480000
      This was the asteroid impact hypothesis for how the Mesozoic era ended.
   Segment 203
      0:14:22.480000 ---> 0:14:26.480000
      A big idea that was just too big for some.
   Segment 204
      0:14:28.480000 ---> 0:14:33.480000
      When the Alvaras hypothesis was first proposed, it was difficult for many scientists to accept.
   Segment 205
      0:14:34.480000 ---> 0:14:43.480000
      Because for almost two centuries, geologists had crafted their worldview around a gradual picture of slow, but steady change in the world.
   Segment 206
      0:14:44.480000 ---> 0:14:48.480000
      They were not able to see the
   Segment 207
      0:14:48.480000 ---> 0:14:51.480000
      Earth in the Earth without major catastrophes.
   Segment 208
      0:14:52.480000 ---> 0:14:59.480000
      Now they were hearing a proposal that something had come from outer space and rewritten the history of life in almost an instant.
   Segment 209
      0:15:00.480000 ---> 0:15:07.480000
      Louis Alvarez got very frustrated when the paleontologist didn't say, yes, sir, thank you for solving our problem.
   Segment 210
      0:15:07.480000 ---> 0:15:14.480000
      They didn't know their field and was stepping into this just because it was such a big, important, famous problem.
   Segment 211
      0:15:16.480000 ---> 0:15:19.480000
      The controversy would continue for years.
   Segment 212
      0:15:20.480000 ---> 0:15:24.480000
      To convince the skeptics, more evidence was needed.
   Segment 213
      0:15:25.480000 ---> 0:15:37.480000
      One criticism of the KT hypothesis was the lack of a crater, the right age, type, and size.
   Segment 214
      0:15:38.480000 ---> 0:15:43.480000
      Alvarez thought it should be 200 kilometers across, bigger than the state of Connecticut.
   Segment 215
      0:15:44.480000 ---> 0:15:47.480000
      How could you miss that?
   Segment 216
      0:15:48.480000 ---> 0:15:57.480000
      They looked. They looked for craters that was 65 million years old all over the Earth. Many of these things had been discovered and had been measured in finany.
   Segment 217
      0:16:00.480000 ---> 0:16:07.480000
      Two-thirds of the planet is covered by water. If the asteroid landed in the ocean, the crater might never be found.
   Segment 218
      0:16:09.480000 ---> 0:16:15.480000
      Even so, there would still be a trail of debris. Ejecta blasted from the crater.
   Segment 219
      0:16:17.480000 ---> 0:16:20.480000
      So attention focused on finding this evidence.
   Segment 220
      0:16:22.480000 ---> 0:16:32.480000
      Geologists Jan Smit discovered glass-like beads in KT boundaries, called spherules, formed when vaporized rock cools and rains back down.
   Segment 221
      0:16:37.480000 ---> 0:16:43.480000
      Another key clue was rock that had been so shocked by the impact, it had crisscrossing bands of dislocated minerals.
   Segment 222
      0:16:44.480000 ---> 0:16:47.480000
      This was shocked quartz.
   Segment 223
      0:16:48.480000 ---> 0:16:54.480000
      And we know if you set up a nuclear bomb, the damage done to the surrounding rocks will produce you a shock quartz.
   Segment 224
      0:16:55.480000 ---> 0:16:59.480000
      So if you put two and two together, we find shock quartz at the KT boundary, shock quartz, and nucleic craters.
   Segment 225
      0:17:00.480000 ---> 0:17:03.480000
      You know it is an explosion which deforms your quartz crystals.
   Segment 226
      0:17:04.480000 ---> 0:17:09.480000
      And quartz is only found on land. So that was the big clue we have to look for a crater somewhere on land.
   Segment 227
      0:17:14.480000 ---> 0:17:22.480000
      The search for fresh clues led here to Texas, along the Brazos River, some 300 kilometers from the Gulf of Mexico.
   Segment 228
      0:17:27.480000 ---> 0:17:31.480000
      65 million years ago, this was the bottom of the sea instead of grazing land.
   Segment 229
      0:17:34.480000 ---> 0:17:39.480000
      In the early 1980s, scientists noted unusual deposits of sediments across the river basin.
   Segment 230
      0:17:43.480000 ---> 0:17:48.480000
      Intrigued, Alan Hildebrand, then a graduate student in geology, came to investigate.
   Segment 231
      0:17:51.480000 ---> 0:17:53.480000
      It's actually easy with the fresh tracks.
   Segment 232
      0:17:54.480000 ---> 0:18:00.480000
      Along the banks of the river in its tributaries, he examined exposures of the KT boundary different from those seen elsewhere.
   Segment 233
      0:18:01.480000 ---> 0:18:07.480000
      And saw something on top of the Cretaceous mud and rock that had once accumulated on the sea floor.
   Segment 234
      0:18:08.480000 ---> 0:18:12.480000
      So this is the typical mud just found in this area?
   Segment 235
      0:18:13.480000 ---> 0:18:16.480000
      Exactly. All we see is this green, Cretaceous mud.
   Segment 236
      0:18:17.480000 ---> 0:18:19.480000
      And there are 7 million years of this mud here.
   Segment 237
      0:18:20.480000 ---> 0:18:22.480000
      So we are talking boring.
   Segment 238
      0:18:23.480000 ---> 0:18:24.480000
      There was nothing going on.
   Segment 239
      0:18:25.480000 ---> 0:18:30.480000
      But see right here, the sea floor has been eroded right at this point.
   Segment 240
      0:18:31.480000 ---> 0:18:38.480000
      An untrained eye might see this sediment and never look twice at the protruding boulders.
   Segment 241
      0:18:39.480000 ---> 0:18:43.480000
      But Hildebrand saw evidence of a catastrophic event.
   Segment 242
      0:18:44.480000 ---> 0:18:47.480000
      So something happened here, it eroded the sea floor.
   Segment 243
      0:18:48.480000 ---> 0:18:51.480000
      And we started seeing these very coarse sediments.
   Segment 244
      0:18:52.480000 ---> 0:18:57.480000
      And this first unit is really quite extraordinary because you'd trace round over here.
   Segment 245
      0:18:57.480000 ---> 0:19:02.480000
      You see, here's a boulder in it that's like 50 centimeters across.
   Segment 246
      0:19:03.480000 ---> 0:19:09.480000
      And you come over here, this is another one, it was weak, so it's weathered out, but it's even bigger.
   Segment 247
      0:19:11.480000 ---> 0:19:15.480000
      Here's another boulder, but notice this boulder is different stuff than these.
   Segment 248
      0:19:16.480000 ---> 0:19:22.480000
      So you had this really regular mud layer, and then all of a sudden this area that's just full of this whole mixture of boulders
   Segment 249
      0:19:22.480000 ---> 0:19:27.480000
      and from different places, it isn't just the rock that was here in the sea floor.
   Segment 250
      0:19:27.480000 ---> 0:19:30.480000
      Maybe some of it got pulled from deep water, maybe some get pulled from cholera,
   Segment 251
      0:19:30.480000 ---> 0:19:32.480000
      it all got jumbled together and dumped here.
   Segment 252
      0:19:32.480000 ---> 0:19:35.480000
      All right, so what could have happened here that would explain something so dramatic?
   Segment 253
      0:19:36.480000 ---> 0:19:40.480000
      Well, had to be a hugely energetic wave in the ocean, a giant tsunami.
   Segment 254
      0:19:45.480000 ---> 0:19:49.480000
      If an asteroid 10 kilometers across landed in the sea or at the edge of a continent,
   Segment 255
      0:19:49.480000 ---> 0:19:57.480000
      it would displace incredible amounts of rock and water, causing tsunamis over 100 meters high.
   Segment 256
      0:19:58.480000 ---> 0:20:06.480000
      These giant waves would have crossed the sea with the speed of a jet, ripping up the sea floor, moving tons of sediment.
   Segment 257
      0:20:07.480000 ---> 0:20:14.480000
      As that debris came to rest in what today is the Brazos River Basin, it would have mixed with ejecta falling from the sky.
   Segment 258
      0:20:20.480000 ---> 0:20:22.480000
      Okay, so now we're here in Texas.
   Segment 259
      0:20:22.480000 ---> 0:20:27.480000
      Is this making you think that you're a little closer to the crater in Texas than you might be in Italy, for example?
   Segment 260
      0:20:27.480000 ---> 0:20:32.480000
      Exactly, because we can see the products of the impact mixed into this tsunami.
   Segment 261
      0:20:32.480000 ---> 0:20:35.480000
      Deposive, so we're getting warm.
   Segment 262
      0:20:39.480000 ---> 0:20:43.480000
      Hildebrand was hot on the trail of every new piece of evidence.
   Segment 263
      0:20:44.480000 ---> 0:20:50.480000
      Next stop, Haiti, where he investigated a report of volcanic rocks.
   Segment 264
      0:20:51.480000 ---> 0:20:57.480000
      As he suspected, they were actually ejecta, full of shocked minerals and spirals.
   Segment 265
      0:20:59.480000 ---> 0:21:04.480000
      They also contained melted rock called tech tights, another telltale sign.
   Segment 266
      0:21:07.480000 ---> 0:21:11.480000
      More evidence that a strike had occurred somewhere around the Gulf of Mexico.
   Segment 267
      0:21:13.480000 ---> 0:21:16.480000
      But somewhere wasn't precise enough.
   Segment 268
      0:21:20.480000 ---> 0:21:25.480000
      Ironically, a key clue discovered by another geologist had long been overlooked.
   Segment 269
      0:21:26.480000 ---> 0:21:31.480000
      Years before, Glenn Penfield had hunted for oil on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.
   Segment 270
      0:21:33.480000 ---> 0:21:36.480000
      From the air, Penfield saw nothing unusual.
   Segment 271
      0:21:37.480000 ---> 0:21:45.480000
      But his instruments measured differences in gravitational fields and revealed the features of a giant buried crater.
   Segment 272
      0:21:48.480000 ---> 0:21:52.480000
      It was Hildebrand, who eventually followed up on Penfield's work.
   Segment 273
      0:21:54.480000 ---> 0:21:59.480000
      Rock samples from the area Penfield identified showed all the signs of a high energy impact.
   Segment 274
      0:22:00.480000 ---> 0:22:03.480000
      And it was full of shocked quartz, too.
   Segment 275
      0:22:04.480000 ---> 0:22:13.480000
      So this evidence finally convinced everybody that indeed there was a big crater buried on the Yucatan Peninsula.
   Segment 276
      0:22:16.480000 ---> 0:22:20.480000
      After years of speculation, the crater had finally been found.
   Segment 277
      0:22:21.480000 ---> 0:22:25.480000
      It was named the Chixalub Crater, after a village built over its center.
   Segment 278
      0:22:26.480000 ---> 0:22:30.480000
      The discovery of the Chixalub Crater was the ultimate evidence of the asteroid impact.
   Segment 279
      0:22:31.480000 ---> 0:22:34.480000
      And it tied together all of the clues that had been gathered over the previous decade.
   Segment 280
      0:22:35.480000 ---> 0:22:39.480000
      The shock quartz, the tech tights, the spirals that had fallen across the earth.
   Segment 281
      0:22:40.480000 ---> 0:22:46.480000
      Moreover, the crater was the same age as the K-T boundary, and it was the size predicted by Louis Alvarez.
   Segment 282
      0:22:47.480000 ---> 0:22:50.480000
      We now knew for certain what happened on that horrible day.
   Segment 283
      0:22:55.480000 ---> 0:22:59.480000
      The asteroid crater had finally been found, but important questions remained.
   Segment 284
      0:22:59.480000 ---> 0:23:04.480000
      The asteroid crater had finally been found, but important questions remained.
   Segment 285
      0:23:07.480000 ---> 0:23:11.480000
      Which species were wiped out at the end of the Mesozoic?
   Segment 286
      0:23:12.480000 ---> 0:23:15.480000
      Which survived, and why?
   Segment 287
      0:23:16.480000 ---> 0:23:19.480000
      The asteroid crater was found in the first place.
   Segment 288
      0:23:20.480000 ---> 0:23:24.480000
      The asteroid crater was found in the first place.
   Segment 289
      0:23:24.480000 ---> 0:23:31.480000
      The search for those answers led to the badlands of the Dakotas and Montana in the Hell Creek Formation.
   Segment 290
      0:23:34.480000 ---> 0:23:43.480000
      It's eroding buttes hold fossils of plants and animals that live during the last million years of the Cretaceous and beyond.
   Segment 291
      0:23:46.480000 ---> 0:23:51.480000
      When paleontologist Kirk Johnson discovered the Great Lakes, the Great Lakes, was the first to see the storm.
   Segment 292
      0:23:52.480000 ---> 0:24:01.480000
      When paleontologist Kirk Johnson discovered this K-T boundary, with its tell-tale spirals, he found the dividing line between two vastly different worlds.
   Segment 293
      0:24:04.480000 ---> 0:24:09.480000
      You're looking at a ball of glass that used to be the bedrock in Chicxalo, Mexico.
   Segment 294
      0:24:12.480000 ---> 0:24:15.480000
      Kirk, how important was it to find the K-T boundary up here in North Dakota?
   Segment 295
      0:24:16.480000 ---> 0:24:25.480000
      If you can put your finger on the boundary like you can right here, what that means is you can ask the very simple question, how was life before the impact different from life after the impact?
   Segment 296
      0:24:27.480000 ---> 0:24:30.480000
      What I got to do is look for the fossils below and compare them with the fossils above.
   Segment 297
      0:24:31.480000 ---> 0:24:33.480000
      And that's what we've done here for the last 30 years.
   Segment 298
      0:24:36.480000 ---> 0:24:39.480000
      This arid landscape was once a wet lush forest.
   Segment 299
      0:24:40.480000 ---> 0:24:47.480000
      Crack open some rocks and you'll find the leaves of plants and trees that flourished here over 65 million years ago.
   Segment 300
      0:24:49.480000 ---> 0:24:50.480000
      Look at that.
   Segment 301
      0:24:51.480000 ---> 0:24:53.480000
      You can even tell what insects ate them.
   Segment 302
      0:24:56.480000 ---> 0:24:58.480000
      See, there's two different kinds of insect damage on this leaf as well.
   Segment 303
      0:24:59.480000 ---> 0:25:02.480000
      Instead of a whole feeding, it's in the leaf and there's a margin feeding on the head.
   Segment 304
      0:25:03.480000 ---> 0:25:10.480000
      Take a close look at the ground and you can pick up fossils of small animals that thrived in lakes, rivers and forests.
   Segment 305
      0:25:12.480000 ---> 0:25:19.480000
      So in my hand I've got evidence of a turtle, fish, arkadile, fish and mammal.
   Segment 306
      0:25:21.480000 ---> 0:25:23.480000
      And then there were the dinosaurs.
   Segment 307
      0:25:25.480000 ---> 0:25:28.480000
      The challenge, connecting their fate to the K-T boundary.
   Segment 308
      0:25:29.480000 ---> 0:25:32.480000
      The clues, their fossilized remains.
   Segment 309
      0:25:34.480000 ---> 0:25:36.480000
      This is an ankle bone of a small meat eating dinosaur.
   Segment 310
      0:25:37.480000 ---> 0:25:43.480000
      And you find these bones identify the animal and pretty soon you start assembling the list of dinosaurs that are present at any given level.
   Segment 311
      0:25:44.480000 ---> 0:25:48.480000
      And the lower you are in the formation, the older you are, and the higher you are, the younger you are.
   Segment 312
      0:25:49.480000 ---> 0:25:53.480000
      And the closer to the boundary you are, the more we address the question of how long the dinosaurs survive.
   Segment 313
      0:25:54.480000 ---> 0:25:59.480000
      So just nearby we found this bone, which is a bone of a much larger meat eating dinosaur.
   Segment 314
      0:26:00.480000 ---> 0:26:02.480000
      Same bone. See the size, difference?
   Segment 315
      0:26:03.480000 ---> 0:26:04.480000
      And here's the exact same bone.
   Segment 316
      0:26:05.480000 ---> 0:26:09.480000
      So when you find bones of different species in the same layer, they are living at the same place at the same time.
   Segment 317
      0:26:13.480000 ---> 0:26:16.480000
      The work takes a great deal of time and patience.
   Segment 318
      0:26:17.480000 ---> 0:26:20.480000
      This is how, basically how you find a dinosaur.
   Segment 319
      0:26:21.480000 ---> 0:26:26.480000
      You know you are walking around, looking in these gullies, and then you spot a piece of bone.
   Segment 320
      0:26:27.480000 ---> 0:26:29.480000
      You can see it's very porous.
   Segment 321
      0:26:30.480000 ---> 0:26:34.480000
      And you know that it had to travel down, the force of gravity.
   Segment 322
      0:26:35.480000 ---> 0:26:38.480000
      You can see the bone trail. Here's a bone, here's a bone.
   Segment 323
      0:26:39.480000 ---> 0:26:40.480000
      Follow the trail of bone up.
   Segment 324
      0:26:41.480000 ---> 0:26:45.480000
      And then here you have, or shin bone of a duck-duck dinosaur.
   Segment 325
      0:26:46.480000 ---> 0:26:51.480000
      Really broken up. And then here's where it would articulate with the knee joint.
   Segment 326
      0:26:56.480000 ---> 0:27:07.480000
      Scientists know that 22 types of dinosaurs lived in Hell Creek, including triceratops, tyrannosaurs, and this duck bill, some 9 meters or 30 feet long.
   Segment 327
      0:27:09.480000 ---> 0:27:13.480000
      The more complete the skeleton, the easier it is to reconstruct the past.
   Segment 328
      0:27:17.480000 ---> 0:27:19.480000
      But discoveries like these are extremely rare.
   Segment 329
      0:27:22.480000 ---> 0:27:29.480000
      You walk around the battle ends out here and you'll pick a numerous, just chunks of dinosaur, chunkosaurus, that's what we call it.
   Segment 330
      0:27:30.480000 ---> 0:27:31.480000
      And that's about it.
   Segment 331
      0:27:32.480000 ---> 0:27:36.480000
      Usually you find piles of bones that aren't articulated, they're not in the correct order.
   Segment 332
      0:27:37.480000 ---> 0:27:41.480000
      So having the vertebrae in the right order like this is very, very rare.
   Segment 333
      0:27:42.480000 ---> 0:27:51.480000
      And what makes this specimen even more important is it's articulated and it's pretty close to the KT boundary.
   Segment 334
      0:27:56.480000 ---> 0:27:59.480000
      We've now found several specimens that are very close to the boundary.
   Segment 335
      0:28:00.480000 ---> 0:28:08.480000
      And really what that's showing us is that even if dinosaurs are rare, if you look long enough, you'll find them when they were living on the planet.
   Segment 336
      0:28:09.480000 ---> 0:28:16.480000
      What we have not found yet is any dinosaur skeleton anywhere in the world above the KT boundary layer.
   Segment 337
      0:28:19.480000 ---> 0:28:21.480000
      Scientists now knew what lived here.
   Segment 338
      0:28:23.480000 ---> 0:28:25.480000
      And their ultimate fate.
   Segment 339
      0:28:28.480000 ---> 0:28:32.480000
      Within a thousand kilometers of the impact, death came quickly.
   Segment 340
      0:28:33.480000 ---> 0:28:43.480000
      If you turn your oven on broil, open the door, put your hand into the glow bar, that's what the dinosaurs felt very soon.
   Segment 341
      0:28:44.480000 ---> 0:28:47.480000
      And they were probably broiled alive within an hour or so.
   Segment 342
      0:28:50.480000 ---> 0:28:54.480000
      For dinosaurs further away, death may have been delayed, but not for long.
   Segment 343
      0:28:55.480000 ---> 0:28:59.480000
      Soon, vaporized ejecta and smoke from fires filled the air.
   Segment 344
      0:29:03.480000 ---> 0:29:11.480000
      And there may have also been a lot of sulfur blown into the atmosphere because the impact site in the Yucatan Peninsula had a lot of sulfur in it.
   Segment 345
      0:29:12.480000 ---> 0:29:17.480000
      And all of those things were abundant enough to obliterate the sun.
   Segment 346
      0:29:18.480000 ---> 0:29:27.480000
      Without light, anything dependent on photosynthesis on land or in the sea was vulnerable.
   Segment 347
      0:29:30.480000 ---> 0:29:34.480000
      As food chains collapsed, giant reptiles still alive died off.
   Segment 348
      0:29:37.480000 ---> 0:29:41.480000
      The Mesozoic Era, the age of dinosaurs, was over.
   Segment 349
      0:29:48.480000 ---> 0:29:50.480000
      And there were other radical changes.
   Segment 350
      0:29:52.480000 ---> 0:29:56.480000
      In Kirk Johnson's Denver lab, you can see what happened to plant life.
   Segment 351
      0:29:59.480000 ---> 0:30:06.480000
      Samples taken from below the KT boundary show a high diversity of pollen grains, stained here in red.
   Segment 352
      0:30:08.480000 ---> 0:30:16.480000
      But above the boundary, this earlier diversity disappears, reflecting the extinction of 60% of all plant species.
   Segment 353
      0:30:18.480000 ---> 0:30:20.480000
      Fernsport. Fernsport.
   Segment 354
      0:30:21.480000 ---> 0:30:24.480000
      Where flowering plants once thrived, ferns took over first.
   Segment 355
      0:30:25.480000 ---> 0:30:26.480000
      Fernsport. Fernsport.
   Segment 356
      0:30:27.480000 ---> 0:30:33.480000
      Unlike pollen, fernspors can germinate on a barren landscape, devoid of living plants.
   Segment 357
      0:30:36.480000 ---> 0:30:39.480000
      We have a short period of time where there's only ferns, that's the fern spike.
   Segment 358
      0:30:40.480000 ---> 0:30:45.480000
      But after that, there's about a million years of time where we have the low diversity, disaster recovery flora.
   Segment 359
      0:30:46.480000 ---> 0:30:48.480000
      And after that first million years, then things start to pick back up again.
   Segment 360
      0:30:49.480000 ---> 0:30:51.480000
      We start to see animals coming back into the landscape.
   Segment 361
      0:30:53.480000 ---> 0:30:58.480000
      In this new post-impact world, the niche that dinosaurs left was waiting to be filled.
   Segment 362
      0:31:01.480000 ---> 0:31:14.480000
      And so the survivors of this on the land were creatures that lived in holes, birds, mice like creatures, turtles, frogs, things that lived in swamps or rivers, or near the seashore.
   Segment 363
      0:31:16.480000 ---> 0:31:21.480000
      And compared to dinosaurs, they had the advantage of size. They were small.
   Segment 364
      0:31:23.480000 ---> 0:31:28.480000
      Small animals have large population size. Small animals have higher reproduction rates.
   Segment 365
      0:31:29.480000 ---> 0:31:35.480000
      Now, it's not saying that small animals didn't suffer mass death, but enough survive, and that's the key point.
   Segment 366
      0:31:38.480000 ---> 0:31:42.480000
      In that million years of recovery, the small inherited the earth.
   Segment 367
      0:31:45.480000 ---> 0:31:48.480000
      It was the beginning of the age of mammals.
   Segment 368
      0:31:50.480000 ---> 0:31:55.480000
      Eventually, larger mammals dominated the land, just as dinosaurs had done before.
   Segment 369
      0:31:58.480000 ---> 0:32:05.480000
      And among them were primitive primates, whose evolution would lead in a very promising direction, at least for humans.
   Segment 370
      0:32:06.480000 ---> 0:32:12.480000
      What the asteroid impact taught us about evolution is that it's not always about survival of the fittest.
   Segment 371
      0:32:13.480000 ---> 0:32:15.480000
      Sometimes, it's about survival of the luckiest.
   Segment 372
      0:32:16.480000 ---> 0:32:18.480000
      And there's a profound point there for our species.
   Segment 373
      0:32:19.480000 ---> 0:32:24.480000
      Only after the extinction of the giant reptiles did mammals flourish, including our primate ancestors.
   Segment 374
      0:32:25.480000 ---> 0:32:28.480000
      Without the asteroid, they'd be no us.

Transcription for The Permian Extinction.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:07.680000
      The Great Dying
   Segment 2
      0:00:07.680000 ---> 0:00:13.600000
      Also referred to as the Permian Triassic Extinction or the Great Permian Extinction.
   Segment 3
      0:00:13.600000 ---> 0:00:19.880000
      About 252 million years ago, here on Earth, something went horribly wrong.
   Segment 4
      0:00:19.880000 ---> 0:00:25.380000
      After life, had been developing to new heights throughout most of the Paliozoic era, 252
   Segment 5
      0:00:25.380000 ---> 0:00:32.900000
      million years ago, up 96% of all marine species and 70% of all terrestrial vertebrate species
   Segment 6
      0:00:32.900000 ---> 0:00:42.620000
      vanished.
   Segment 7
      0:00:42.620000 ---> 0:00:50.580000
      The reason as to how 57% of all biological families and 83% of all genera became extinct
   Segment 8
      0:00:50.580000 ---> 0:00:53.380000
      is something we still aren't too sure about today.
   Segment 9
      0:00:53.380000 ---> 0:00:59.300000
      At the start of the Permian period, the Earth's atmosphere was rich on oxygen to 23% while
   Segment 10
      0:00:59.300000 ---> 0:01:04.020000
      carbon dioxide levels were around 900 parts per million, about over 2 times the current
   Segment 11
      0:01:04.020000 ---> 0:01:05.700000
      levels.
   Segment 12
      0:01:05.700000 ---> 0:01:10.580000
      The average surface temperature was about 16 degrees and sea levels were at 60 meters
   Segment 13
      0:01:10.580000 ---> 0:01:12.220000
      below their present.
   Segment 14
      0:01:12.220000 ---> 0:01:15.020000
      The climate in the Permian period was quite varied.
   Segment 15
      0:01:15.020000 ---> 0:01:19.940000
      At the start of the Permian period, the Earth was still on an ice age, which began earlier
   Segment 16
      0:01:19.940000 ---> 0:01:21.580000
      in the Carboniferous period.
   Segment 17
      0:01:21.580000 ---> 0:01:25.540000
      The most prominent and noticeable change the Permian broad was the formation of a new
   Segment 18
      0:01:25.540000 ---> 0:01:29.260000
      supercontinent, Pangea.
   Segment 19
      0:01:29.260000 ---> 0:01:33.740000
      Glaciers proceeded around the mid-Permian as the climate gradually warmed.
   Segment 20
      0:01:33.740000 ---> 0:01:37.820000
      Due to the formation of the supercontinent Pangea, this was the main change during the
   Segment 21
      0:01:37.820000 ---> 0:01:43.700000
      Permian, the formation of a supercontinent created vast amounts of desert land on Earth,
   Segment 22
      0:01:43.700000 ---> 0:01:48.860000
      as the rain clouds weren't able to reach that far inland and soon the land dried.
   Segment 23
      0:01:49.340000 ---> 0:01:54.700000
      In a few thousand years, Pangea dried out in a fast desert larger than any ever seen
   Segment 24
      0:01:54.700000 ---> 0:01:56.620000
      on Earth would form.
   Segment 25
      0:01:56.620000 ---> 0:02:01.980000
      To be specific, Pangea they formed two deserts, as Gondwana and Eurasia merged together in
   Segment 26
      0:02:01.980000 ---> 0:02:06.300000
      the early Permian, a mountain-range formed between them, separating a northern and a
   Segment 27
      0:02:06.300000 ---> 0:02:08.380000
      southern desert.
   Segment 28
      0:02:08.380000 ---> 0:02:13.420000
      The Permian saw the completion of a saga that had been going on since the Carboniferous,
   Segment 29
      0:02:13.420000 ---> 0:02:15.780000
      the rise of the reptiles.
   Segment 30
      0:02:15.780000 ---> 0:02:20.900000
      Reptiles, like the Metrodance, dominated the early Permian, while they diverseed more towards
   Segment 31
      0:02:20.900000 ---> 0:02:22.620000
      the end of the Permian.
   Segment 32
      0:02:22.620000 ---> 0:02:28.380000
      The new, dry desert environment was perfect for reptiles to thrive in, scooter source,
   Segment 33
      0:02:28.380000 ---> 0:02:32.220000
      designer dance, quark and upsets and other strife here.
   Segment 34
      0:02:32.220000 ---> 0:02:35.860000
      Despite harsh conditions, life remained doing well.
   Segment 35
      0:02:35.860000 ---> 0:02:41.820000
      Then, 252 million years ago, on the end of the Permian and start of the Triassic period,
   Segment 36
      0:02:41.820000 ---> 0:02:46.780000
      all of this collapsed in the greatest mass extinction life on Earth has ever seen.
   Segment 37
      0:02:46.780000 ---> 0:02:52.660000
      Unlike the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, the cause for the Permian
   Segment 38
      0:02:52.660000 ---> 0:02:54.860000
      extinction is less clear.
   Segment 39
      0:02:54.860000 ---> 0:03:00.180000
      Not only because it happened far longer ago, but also because in unlikelihood there wasn't
   Segment 40
      0:03:00.180000 ---> 0:03:01.580000
      a single cause.
   Segment 41
      0:03:01.580000 ---> 0:03:06.380000
      The Permian extinction likely started with one Kickstarter event that put into motion
   Segment 42
      0:03:06.380000 ---> 0:03:11.620000
      a tragic sequence leading to the Great Dying, the sequence, and its trigger, have puzzled
   Segment 43
      0:03:11.620000 ---> 0:03:15.700000
      scientists ever since the first evidence for the event was first discovered.
   Segment 44
      0:03:15.700000 ---> 0:03:20.420000
      One of the first clues we got was from sedimentary rocks, pointing to a rapid increase in the
   Segment 45
      0:03:20.420000 ---> 0:03:23.020000
      Earth's temperature at the end of the Permian.
   Segment 46
      0:03:23.020000 ---> 0:03:28.220000
      The temperatures might have risen as much as 11 degrees centigrade in a short amount of
   Segment 47
      0:03:28.220000 ---> 0:03:29.220000
      time.
   Segment 48
      0:03:29.220000 ---> 0:03:34.140000
      This was already evidence against an asteroid strike being the cause, as the ash of the impact
   Segment 49
      0:03:34.140000 ---> 0:03:38.660000
      would have blocked the sun and caused temperatures to fall, rather than rise.
   Segment 50
      0:03:38.660000 ---> 0:03:42.900000
      On top of that, an asteroid impact would cause an extinction really fast.
   Segment 51
      0:03:42.900000 ---> 0:03:48.940000
      While the fossil record suggests the Great Dying was smeared over at least 150,000 years
   Segment 52
      0:03:48.940000 ---> 0:03:49.940000
      of time.
   Segment 53
      0:03:49.940000 ---> 0:03:55.500000
      The next most obvious target would be something not from space, but from the Earth itself.
   Segment 54
      0:03:55.500000 ---> 0:04:01.580000
      Volcanic activity has proven to be cataclysmic, but for a volcanic cause to the Permian extinction,
   Segment 55
      0:04:01.740000 ---> 0:04:05.500000
      there would have to have been some unseen magnitudes of it.
   Segment 56
      0:04:05.500000 ---> 0:04:07.940000
      Enter the Siberian Traps.
   Segment 57
      0:04:07.940000 ---> 0:04:12.820000
      This is a large region of volcanic rock in Siberia, Russia.
   Segment 58
      0:04:12.820000 ---> 0:04:17.820000
      The massive eruptive event that formed the traps is one of the largest known volcanic
   Segment 59
      0:04:17.820000 ---> 0:04:23.900000
      mass eruptions that has occurred on Earth in the last 500 million years.
   Segment 60
      0:04:23.900000 ---> 0:04:28.380000
      Eruptions here continued for over 2 million years and were right on top of the Permian.
   Segment 61
      0:04:28.540000 ---> 0:04:33.980000
      About 52 million years ago, a giant blob of magma built up beneath the Siberian crust.
   Segment 62
      0:04:33.980000 ---> 0:04:39.620000
      The number of volcanoes at the time must have been insufficient to vent the heat and pressure
   Segment 63
      0:04:39.620000 ---> 0:04:44.460000
      as the entire crust would begin to bulge upwards until it cracked.
   Segment 64
      0:04:44.460000 ---> 0:04:48.420000
      The resulting magma eruption was unseen in the Earth's history.
   Segment 65
      0:04:48.420000 ---> 0:04:53.900000
      The entire landscape would have erupted and turned into a sea of lava.
   Segment 66
      0:04:53.900000 ---> 0:04:58.180000
      Being alive right there would have been incinerated instantly.
   Segment 67
      0:04:58.180000 ---> 0:05:03.020000
      An eruption like this is called the bezel plot and involves the landscape being covered
   Segment 68
      0:05:03.020000 ---> 0:05:04.500000
      in molten rock.
   Segment 69
      0:05:04.500000 ---> 0:05:10.300000
      The Siberian Traps released enough lava to cover an area the size of the mainland United
   Segment 70
      0:05:10.300000 ---> 0:05:14.260000
      States beneath a kilometer of molten rock.
   Segment 71
      0:05:14.260000 ---> 0:05:19.500000
      Besides lava, volcanoes released lots of ash and gases.
   Segment 72
      0:05:19.500000 ---> 0:05:24.940000
      The ash will cover a much larger area than the lava being released into the atmosphere
   Segment 73
      0:05:24.940000 ---> 0:05:28.140000
      and snowing down upon the surrounding area.
   Segment 74
      0:05:28.140000 ---> 0:05:33.820000
      For regular volcanic eruptions, this can be to hundreds of kilometers from the volcano.
   Segment 75
      0:05:33.820000 ---> 0:05:38.340000
      In case of the Siberian eruptions, this was global.
   Segment 76
      0:05:38.340000 ---> 0:05:45.780000
      Worldwide its snowed volcanic ash, the hot toxic snow burned and killed the plants.
   Segment 77
      0:05:45.780000 ---> 0:05:49.180000
      The gases released made even worse than it already was.
   Segment 78
      0:05:49.180000 ---> 0:05:53.100000
      Much sulfur and carbon dioxide was released by the eruption.
   Segment 79
      0:05:53.100000 ---> 0:05:57.620000
      Sulfur dioxide mixed with water in the atmosphere forms acid rain.
   Segment 80
      0:05:57.620000 ---> 0:06:02.500000
      The volcanic ash and acid rain spelled doom for the vegetation on Earth.
   Segment 81
      0:06:02.500000 ---> 0:06:07.020000
      Dying plants meant starving planet years and the carnivores had eat them.
   Segment 82
      0:06:07.020000 ---> 0:06:10.780000
      At this point, 10% of the Earth's biodiversity was already gone.
   Segment 83
      0:06:10.780000 ---> 0:06:15.340000
      But the collapse of the food chain was only the beginning of the greatest mass extinction
   Segment 84
      0:06:15.340000 ---> 0:06:17.420000
      in the Earth as ever seen.
   Segment 85
      0:06:17.420000 ---> 0:06:21.620000
      Not all the gas came down back on Earth as acid rain.
   Segment 86
      0:06:21.620000 ---> 0:06:24.540000
      Most of the carbon dioxide stayed in the atmosphere.
   Segment 87
      0:06:24.540000 ---> 0:06:29.340000
      As we all know, carbon dioxide is a big, bad greenhouse gas.
   Segment 88
      0:06:29.340000 ---> 0:06:34.460000
      Global warming due to carbon dioxide release is naturally kept in check by plants absorbing
   Segment 89
      0:06:34.460000 ---> 0:06:37.060000
      the CO2 back from the atmosphere.
   Segment 90
      0:06:37.060000 ---> 0:06:42.620000
      But the plants were dying globally and the carbon dioxide levels surged.
   Segment 91
      0:06:42.700000 ---> 0:06:47.180000
      It's estimated that the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere during the eruptions were
   Segment 92
      0:06:47.180000 ---> 0:06:52.300000
      20 times higher than today, both industrial 400 per million that is.
   Segment 93
      0:06:52.300000 ---> 0:06:56.820000
      So 2000 per per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
   Segment 94
      0:06:56.820000 ---> 0:07:00.980000
      It wasn't before long that temperatures began to rise due to this.
   Segment 95
      0:07:00.980000 ---> 0:07:06.020000
      At this large concentrations of carbon dioxide, global warming goes wild.
   Segment 96
      0:07:06.020000 ---> 0:07:11.660000
      In a very short amount of time, the temperature rose by as much as 5 degrees.
   Segment 97
      0:07:11.660000 ---> 0:07:17.300000
      5 degrees may not sound as much to us, but it was absolutely devastating to the Earth's
   Segment 98
      0:07:17.300000 ---> 0:07:18.300000
      biasware.
   Segment 99
      0:07:18.300000 ---> 0:07:22.620000
      Most biomes were completely shifted if not destroyed at all by it.
   Segment 100
      0:07:22.620000 ---> 0:07:29.100000
      At this point, extinction rates rose to 40%, but it got worse even still.
   Segment 101
      0:07:29.100000 ---> 0:07:33.060000
      The rise in temperatures warmed the oceans.
   Segment 102
      0:07:33.060000 ---> 0:07:38.060000
      Marine life is even more sensitive to temperature changes than terrestrial fauna.
   Segment 103
      0:07:38.060000 ---> 0:07:42.180000
      The warmer atmosphere stripped the oceans of oxygen.
   Segment 104
      0:07:42.180000 ---> 0:07:48.140000
      Most of the oceans became stagnant, and pretty much everything except algae died.
   Segment 105
      0:07:48.140000 ---> 0:07:53.340000
      Coral reefs, tridobites, predators, everything was gone.
   Segment 106
      0:07:53.340000 ---> 0:07:59.340000
      And in the new oxygen deprived oceans, anaerobic bacteria, such as pink algae, took over.
   Segment 107
      0:07:59.340000 ---> 0:08:04.780000
      The anaerobic bacteria that took over released hydrogen sulfide into the oceans.
   Segment 108
      0:08:04.780000 ---> 0:08:09.420000
      As a consequence, the oceans would turn pink due to this gas being released.
   Segment 109
      0:08:09.420000 ---> 0:08:13.780000
      And during the Permin extinction, a look at Earth from space where that revealed a rare
   Segment 110
      0:08:13.780000 ---> 0:08:16.660000
      view of shallow pinkish seas.
   Segment 111
      0:08:16.660000 ---> 0:08:22.580000
      CO2 deposited on the ocean floors was released as a minor runaway greenhouse effect started
   Segment 112
      0:08:22.580000 ---> 0:08:24.340000
      to take action on Earth.
   Segment 113
      0:08:24.340000 ---> 0:08:29.660000
      On the ocean floor, methane hydrant deposits, which are a frozen form of methane, stored
   Segment 114
      0:08:29.660000 ---> 0:08:33.780000
      at the ocean floor, got released due to the warmer water.
   Segment 115
      0:08:33.780000 ---> 0:08:38.860000
      Sun hydrate is a really interesting molecule where hydrates have encapsored methane within
   Segment 116
      0:08:38.860000 ---> 0:08:45.740000
      the crystal structure of water, forming a solid similar to ice, methane ice.
   Segment 117
      0:08:45.740000 ---> 0:08:51.380000
      Because it still contains methane, and methane is a greenhouse gas too, at least 20 times
   Segment 118
      0:08:51.380000 ---> 0:08:54.300000
      deadlier than carbon dioxide.
   Segment 119
      0:08:54.300000 ---> 0:08:58.900000
      And the warmer water in the oceans caused the crystal capsule around the methane to
   Segment 120
      0:08:58.900000 ---> 0:09:03.660000
      defreeze, releasing the methane into the atmosphere.
   Segment 121
      0:09:03.660000 ---> 0:09:08.380000
      This caused the temperature to rise another 6 degrees.
   Segment 122
      0:09:08.380000 ---> 0:09:13.940000
      An 11 degree rise in the Earth's temperature was cataclysmic for species on Earth.
   Segment 123
      0:09:13.940000 ---> 0:09:20.300000
      The Earth was now 42 degrees on average, where the temperature finally stopped rising.
   Segment 124
      0:09:20.300000 ---> 0:09:26.660000
      Unable to adapt to the temperature rise, 93% of life on Earth ceased to exist.
   Segment 125
      0:09:26.660000 ---> 0:09:31.820000
      With 42 degrees, Earth had also come on the verge of a runaway greenhouse effect.
   Segment 126
      0:09:31.820000 ---> 0:09:36.220000
      For people who have seen my What went wrong on Venus video, you know how disastrous this
   Segment 127
      0:09:36.220000 ---> 0:09:37.300000
      would have been.
   Segment 128
      0:09:37.300000 ---> 0:09:42.020000
      And knowing we came only 5 degrees short of triggering in an Earth is something to think
   Segment 129
      0:09:42.020000 ---> 0:09:43.020000
      about.
   Segment 130
      0:09:43.020000 ---> 0:09:48.500000
      In the new, hot, desolate world that remained, only a few animals survived, by scavenging
   Segment 131
      0:09:48.500000 ---> 0:09:51.060000
      everything left and hiding underground.
   Segment 132
      0:09:51.060000 ---> 0:09:53.980000
      Further, everything else was dead.
   Segment 133
      0:09:53.980000 ---> 0:10:01.780000
      The Siberian eruptions continued for 500,000 years, spilling out lava, ash and gases.
   Segment 134
      0:10:02.260000 ---> 0:10:06.820000
      And when they eventually finally stopped, it took the Earth 2 million years to recover
   Segment 135
      0:10:06.820000 ---> 0:10:09.220000
      and temperatures to return to slightly normal.
   Segment 136
      0:10:09.220000 ---> 0:10:15.060000
      For vegetation, to return it took about 5 million years, and for biodiversity to recover,
   Segment 137
      0:10:15.060000 ---> 0:10:17.220000
      it took about 10 million.
   Segment 138
      0:10:17.220000 ---> 0:10:21.740000
      From the surviving species, in the following Triassic period, arose the dinosaurs as the
   Segment 139
      0:10:21.740000 ---> 0:10:24.220000
      new dominant species on the planet.
   Segment 140
      0:10:24.220000 ---> 0:10:29.660000
      And that's how the Earth's greatest mass extinction, 252 million years ago happened.
   Segment 141
      0:10:29.740000 ---> 0:10:36.140000
      A 500,000 year long basalt flood that put in motion a chain of events that spilled doom
   Segment 142
      0:10:36.140000 ---> 0:10:38.140000
      for species on Earth at the time.

Transcription for The search for alien life# how do we know where to look#.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:07.200000
      Are we alone in the universe?
   Segment 2
      0:00:07.200000 ---> 0:00:10.140000
      Is life a commonplace occurrence in the cosmos?
   Segment 3
      0:00:10.140000 ---> 0:00:15.120000
      Or are we somehow unique and miraculous?
   Segment 4
      0:00:15.120000 ---> 0:00:20.760000
      With today's high-powered telescopes and space explorations, it seems we're closer than ever
   Segment 5
      0:00:20.760000 ---> 0:00:24.880000
      to answering these centuries-old questions.
   Segment 6
      0:00:24.880000 ---> 0:00:30.360000
      But how do we know where to look for life amid billions of galaxies?
   Segment 7
      0:00:30.360000 ---> 0:00:41.360000
      And would we even recognize life out there if we found it?
   Segment 8
      0:00:41.360000 ---> 0:00:44.400000
      Earth is the only place that we know actually has life.
   Segment 9
      0:00:44.400000 ---> 0:00:51.560000
      So we have one example and that becomes our exemplar for the rest of the universe, but
   Segment 10
      0:00:51.560000 ---> 0:00:55.560000
      that kind of approach may actually mislead us.
   Segment 11
      0:00:55.560000 ---> 0:01:00.840000
      In many ways, our search for extraterrestrial life has been a search for our own reflection,
   Segment 12
      0:01:00.840000 ---> 0:01:06.080000
      because life on Earth is the only model of life we have.
   Segment 13
      0:01:06.080000 ---> 0:01:08.680000
      So what is that model?
   Segment 14
      0:01:08.680000 ---> 0:01:19.080000
      All life on Earth has the same basic needs- liquid water, an energy source, and chemical
   Segment 15
      0:01:19.080000 ---> 0:01:22.800000
      building blocks.
   Segment 16
      0:01:22.800000 ---> 0:01:28.960000
      So astrobiologists have approached their search with that same list of requirements.
   Segment 17
      0:01:28.960000 ---> 0:01:31.960000
      At the top of that list is liquid water.
   Segment 18
      0:01:31.960000 ---> 0:01:35.440000
      Water is a really good solvent, which means that you can dissolve things really easily
   Segment 19
      0:01:35.440000 ---> 0:01:40.480000
      into it, and it also likes to form lots of chemical bonds with different molecules that
   Segment 20
      0:01:40.480000 ---> 0:01:43.160000
      are beneficial for life.
   Segment 21
      0:01:43.160000 ---> 0:01:48.480000
      In looking for watery worlds, astronomers use a concept called the habitable zone, also
   Segment 22
      0:01:48.480000 ---> 0:01:52.200000
      known by its nickname, as the Goldilocks Zone.
   Segment 23
      0:01:52.200000 ---> 0:01:57.320000
      The Goldilocks Zone is the region around a star, where a planet heated by the star is
   Segment 24
      0:01:57.320000 ---> 0:02:02.560000
      not too hot, not too cold, but just right for life.
   Segment 25
      0:02:02.560000 ---> 0:02:08.640000
      In that just right zone, water can exist in a liquid form, and that's exactly where Earth
   Segment 26
      0:02:08.640000 ---> 0:02:11.080000
      is in our solar system.
   Segment 27
      0:02:11.080000 ---> 0:02:17.840000
      But Earth's neighbors, Mars, and Venus illustrate the boundaries of this zone.
   Segment 28
      0:02:17.840000 ---> 0:02:23.800000
      With an average temperature of 864 degrees Fahrenheit, Venus is too hot.
   Segment 29
      0:02:23.800000 ---> 0:02:32.320000
      Mars is almost too cold, but trace evidence of seeping water has been found there.
   Segment 30
      0:02:32.320000 ---> 0:02:36.600000
      In recent years, astronomers have expanded their search to include planets orbiting other
   Segment 31
      0:02:36.600000 ---> 0:02:39.480000
      stars, known as exoplanets.
   Segment 32
      0:02:39.480000 ---> 0:02:44.200000
      But just because a planet falls within the habitable zone around a distant star doesn't
   Segment 33
      0:02:44.200000 ---> 0:02:49.240000
      mean that the planet has liquid water, or that it's easy to find out.
   Segment 34
      0:02:49.240000 ---> 0:02:51.880000
      Sarah Seger is hunting for just such a world.
   Segment 35
      0:02:51.880000 ---> 0:02:57.040000
      If we can look at its atmosphere, we'll search for water vapor, and gas that on a rocky
   Segment 36
      0:02:57.040000 ---> 0:03:03.400000
      planet shouldn't be there unless there are liquid ocean reservoirs.
   Segment 37
      0:03:03.400000 ---> 0:03:08.640000
      But it turns out, the Goldilocks Zone isn't the only place to find liquid water.
   Segment 38
      0:03:08.640000 ---> 0:03:13.960000
      Already, liquid water has been found on some of Saturn and Jupiter's moons, far from the
   Segment 39
      0:03:13.960000 ---> 0:03:16.400000
      warmth of the sun.
   Segment 40
      0:03:16.400000 ---> 0:03:22.360000
      These icy moons were long thought to be too frozen to be habitable, but recent NASA missions
   Segment 41
      0:03:22.360000 ---> 0:03:28.680000
      have detected liquid water spewing out into space, fueled by subsurface oceans.
   Segment 42
      0:03:28.680000 ---> 0:03:33.160000
      There, the heat comes from another source, gravity.
   Segment 43
      0:03:33.160000 ---> 0:03:39.320000
      Many of these moons have orbits that are not circular, and so they experience a changing
   Segment 44
      0:03:39.320000 ---> 0:03:45.280000
      gravitational force as they orbit around their apparent planets.
   Segment 45
      0:03:45.280000 ---> 0:03:51.120000
      And that changing gravitational force creates friction that melts the frozen moon from within.
   Segment 46
      0:03:51.120000 ---> 0:03:56.240000
      This process, called tidal heating, opens the door for other places to be considered
   Segment 47
      0:03:56.240000 ---> 0:04:00.240000
      just right for life, too.
   Segment 48
      0:04:00.240000 ---> 0:04:05.480000
      One of those places is Enceladus, an icy moon circling Saturn.
   Segment 49
      0:04:05.480000 ---> 0:04:09.720000
      And it has become a strong contender in the search for life.
   Segment 50
      0:04:09.720000 ---> 0:04:16.160000
      NASA's Cassini spacecraft found that Enceladus' salty subsurface ocean contains four of the
   Segment 51
      0:04:16.160000 ---> 0:04:20.120000
      chemical elements thought to be required for life as we know it.
   Segment 52
      0:04:20.120000 ---> 0:04:25.760000
      There's also evidence that chemistry within Enceladus' ocean might be producing a food
   Segment 53
      0:04:25.760000 ---> 0:04:28.920000
      source for microorganisms.
   Segment 54
      0:04:28.920000 ---> 0:04:34.960000
      So Enceladus almost checks off all three requirements for life as we know it.
   Segment 55
      0:04:34.960000 ---> 0:04:39.720000
      These remaining requirements could still be there, but the Cassini spacecraft was not
   Segment 56
      0:04:39.720000 ---> 0:04:47.280000
      equipped to detect them, or even life itself.
   Segment 57
      0:04:47.280000 ---> 0:04:53.440000
      So if life could exist outside the Goldilocks zone, perhaps searching for a world or life
   Segment 58
      0:04:53.440000 ---> 0:04:58.080000
      that is our reflection is also too narrow of an approach.
   Segment 59
      0:04:58.080000 ---> 0:05:02.640000
      Jonathan Loonin is willing to entertain that possibility.
   Segment 60
      0:05:02.640000 ---> 0:05:07.920000
      And thanks to his work on NASA's Cassini mission to Saturn, he knows just where to
   Segment 61
      0:05:07.920000 ---> 0:05:10.360000
      look to find out.
   Segment 62
      0:05:10.360000 ---> 0:05:14.440000
      Titan, the ringed planet's largest moon.
   Segment 63
      0:05:14.440000 ---> 0:05:19.880000
      Titan has methane, which plays the role on Titan that water plays on the Earth.
   Segment 64
      0:05:19.880000 ---> 0:05:23.680000
      The methane makes clouds, makes rain.
   Segment 65
      0:05:23.680000 ---> 0:05:29.560000
      The rain runs down into streams and rivers and ultimately into lakes and seas.
   Segment 66
      0:05:29.560000 ---> 0:05:38.200000
      Methane plays host to the origin and evolution of a very exotic form of life.
   Segment 67
      0:05:38.200000 ---> 0:05:42.320000
      Perhaps, but there are a few complications.
   Segment 68
      0:05:42.320000 ---> 0:05:47.880000
      It's very, very cold, which means that reactions that need to occur within a micro-urnism happen
   Segment 69
      0:05:47.880000 ---> 0:05:53.320000
      at very, very low speeds and maybe too low, but given that we don't know what the boundaries
   Segment 70
      0:05:53.320000 ---> 0:05:58.520000
      of life are, it is definitely possible that life could exist in these types of environments.
   Segment 71
      0:05:58.520000 ---> 0:06:03.120000
      The cells on Titan would be completely alien to anything that we have on the Earth and
   Segment 72
      0:06:03.120000 ---> 0:06:07
      would look like experiments coming out of an organic chemistry lab.
   Segment 73
      0:06:07 ---> 0:06:12.800000
      Titan is the place to go to stretch the boundaries of habitability and stretch the boundaries
   Segment 74
      0:06:12.800000 ---> 0:06:17.080000
      of life.
   Segment 75
      0:06:17.080000 ---> 0:06:23.040000
      So how then do scientists navigate the challenge of having multiple, or even unimagined, models
   Segment 76
      0:06:23.040000 ---> 0:06:24.360000
      of life?
   Segment 77
      0:06:24.360000 ---> 0:06:27.920000
      A big part of that challenge is designing the right tools.
   Segment 78
      0:06:27.920000 ---> 0:06:31.160000
      How do you search for something you've never seen before?
   Segment 79
      0:06:31.160000 ---> 0:06:33.680000
      There are two different pathways that you can take.
   Segment 80
      0:06:33.680000 ---> 0:06:39.320000
      One is constructing an instrument that is going to make the fewest amount of assumptions.
   Segment 81
      0:06:39.320000 ---> 0:06:43.640000
      But the problem is that with that type of instrumentation, you might not know that you're
   Segment 82
      0:06:43.640000 ---> 0:06:44.640000
      detecting life.
   Segment 83
      0:06:44.640000 ---> 0:06:47.400000
      You might not get that unambiguous signal.
   Segment 84
      0:06:47.400000 ---> 0:06:51.280000
      The other side of the coin is constructing an instrument that's very, very specific that's
   Segment 85
      0:06:51.280000 ---> 0:06:55.600000
      looking for a specific molecule or a set of molecules that are indicative of life as
   Segment 86
      0:06:55.600000 ---> 0:06:56.960000
      we know it.
   Segment 87
      0:06:56.960000 ---> 0:07:00.560000
      The problem then is what happens if you find life as we don't know it.
   Segment 88
      0:07:00.560000 ---> 0:07:01.960000
      Will that instrument still work?
   Segment 89
      0:07:01.960000 ---> 0:07:04
      Will we be able to detect life?
   Segment 90
      0:07:04 ---> 0:07:10.480000
      So it's a balancing act when you conduct a life detection mission on another planet.
   Segment 91
      0:07:10.480000 ---> 0:07:15.200000
      Dr. Poneffract is working on an instrument that relies on the very specific assumption
   Segment 92
      0:07:15.200000 ---> 0:07:20
      that life would use DNA, or at least something very similar to it.
   Segment 93
      0:07:20 ---> 0:07:25.240000
      On board a future Mars rover, this tool would sift through Martian soils, searching for genetic
   Segment 94
      0:07:25.240000 ---> 0:07:28.520000
      evidence of microbes.
   Segment 95
      0:07:28.520000 ---> 0:07:34.840000
      When looking at planets outside our solar system, Dr. Seager makes just one basic assumption.
   Segment 96
      0:07:34.840000 ---> 0:07:42.160000
      And that is that life elsewhere will use chemistry, like we do, to extract energy, to store energy,
   Segment 97
      0:07:42.160000 ---> 0:07:46.400000
      and that in the process, just like life on earth does, chemistry will produce byproduct
   Segment 98
      0:07:46.400000 ---> 0:07:48.040000
      gases.
   Segment 99
      0:07:49.040000 ---> 0:07:57.080000
      But I often wonder, are we like omitting to think about huge categories of life?
   Segment 100
      0:07:57.080000 ---> 0:08:00.840000
      You know, could you imagine that there's some life that uses wind currents or ocean currents
   Segment 101
      0:08:00.840000 ---> 0:08:04.360000
      and traps mechanical energy and uses it without chemistry?
   Segment 102
      0:08:04.360000 ---> 0:08:08.160000
      We'd never see that kind of life.
   Segment 103
      0:08:08.160000 ---> 0:08:12.720000
      That doesn't mean we have to throw out the Earth Life model, but we need to look at it
   Segment 104
      0:08:12.720000 ---> 0:08:16.560000
      through a broader, more flexible lens.
   Segment 105
      0:08:16.560000 ---> 0:08:21.600000
      And this willingness to open our minds to new possibilities has already led us to tantalizing
   Segment 106
      0:08:21.600000 ---> 0:08:25.960000
      discoveries, even within our own solar system.
   Segment 107
      0:08:25.960000 ---> 0:08:31.080000
      Whether alien life looks like us or not, the quest to find it, and our understanding of
   Segment 108
      0:08:31.080000 ---> 0:08:35.640000
      life, continues to evolve.
   Segment 109
      0:08:35.640000 ---> 0:08:43.360000
      Finding life beyond the Earth, even primitive life, it would mean that life is a normal
   Segment 110
      0:08:43.360000 ---> 0:08:45.680000
      part of cosmic evolution.
   Segment 111
      0:08:45.680000 ---> 0:08:50.720000
      And that would change our views, I think, of our place in the cosmos.

Transcription for This Nuclear Robot Could Tunnel for Alien Life on Europa.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:04.440000
      Right now, you're looking at a rendering of a nuclear-powered tunneling robot designed
   Segment 2
      0:00:04.440000 ---> 0:00:06.360000
      to find life on Europa.
   Segment 3
      0:00:06.360000 ---> 0:00:10.280000
      It looks like an Alaskan bull worm.
   Segment 4
      0:00:10.280000 ---> 0:00:14.800000
      At the American Geophysical Union's conference in December 2018, scientists gathered from
   Segment 5
      0:00:14.800000 ---> 0:00:18.240000
      around the world to present their concepts for future space missions.
   Segment 6
      0:00:18.240000 ---> 0:00:22.480000
      There were dragonfly-inspired drones for Titan, probes designed to take the temperature
   Segment 7
      0:00:22.480000 ---> 0:00:27.720000
      of Io's volcanoes, but perhaps the coolest of them all was a tunneling worm robot designed
   Segment 8
      0:00:27.720000 ---> 0:00:29.880000
      to bore through Europa's icy shell.
   Segment 9
      0:00:29.880000 ---> 0:00:33.960000
      The bot was designed by NASA's Compass team, a group of engineers tasked with ideating
   Segment 10
      0:00:33.960000 ---> 0:00:36.920000
      system designs for space exploration missions.
   Segment 11
      0:00:36.920000 ---> 0:00:42.360000
      In Jupiter's icy moon Europa is a prime target because, well, there might be life there.
   Segment 12
      0:00:42.360000 ---> 0:00:47.880000
      For years, scientists have suspected Europa has an iron core, a rocky mantle, and a global
   Segment 13
      0:00:47.880000 ---> 0:00:49.960000
      ocean of liquid water.
   Segment 14
      0:00:49.960000 ---> 0:00:55.400000
      And in 2013, the Hubble Space Telescope observed possible evidence of plumes of water on Europa's
   Segment 15
      0:00:55.400000 ---> 0:00:58.680000
      surface, suggesting that it's geologically active.
   Segment 16
      0:00:58.680000 ---> 0:01:02.720000
      Scientists even think there could be hydrothermal vents on its sea floor, supporting all kinds
   Segment 17
      0:01:02.720000 ---> 0:01:03.960000
      of alien life.
   Segment 18
      0:01:03.960000 ---> 0:01:06.840000
      So obviously we want to go there and take a swim.
   Segment 19
      0:01:06.840000 ---> 0:01:12.160000
      But the oceans lie beneath an estimated 15-25 kilometers of ice, which makes exploring
   Segment 20
      0:01:12.160000 ---> 0:01:13.500000
      them a challenge.
   Segment 21
      0:01:13.500000 ---> 0:01:15.360000
      That's where the tunneling robot comes in.
   Segment 22
      0:01:15.360000 ---> 0:01:19.120000
      About five meters in length, the robot is covered with hot plates that would melt the
   Segment 23
      0:01:19.120000 ---> 0:01:21.760000
      ice during its descent into the deep unknown.
   Segment 24
      0:01:21.760000 ---> 0:01:25.200000
      On board, the bot would carry all sorts of instruments and equipment, allowing it to
   Segment 25
      0:01:25.200000 ---> 0:01:27.120000
      take samples as it goes.
   Segment 26
      0:01:27.120000 ---> 0:01:31.720000
      It would also have cables or a flotation device to keep it from sinking once it reaches Europa's
   Segment 27
      0:01:31.720000 ---> 0:01:32.720000
      ocean.
   Segment 28
      0:01:32.720000 ---> 0:01:36.520000
      So it can just hang there, stick in its nose into the alien bikini bottom.
   Segment 29
      0:01:36.520000 ---> 0:01:40.920000
      All the data gathered would then be transmitted via fiber optic cables back to a lander at
   Segment 30
      0:01:40.920000 ---> 0:01:41.920000
      the surface.
   Segment 31
      0:01:41.920000 ---> 0:01:42.920000
      Oh yeah.
   Segment 32
      0:01:42.920000 ---> 0:01:47.760000
      And the whole thing is either powered by general-purpose heat source bricks containing plutonium or
   Segment 33
      0:01:47.760000 ---> 0:01:50.320000
      an onboard nuclear reactor.
   Segment 34
      0:01:50.320000 ---> 0:01:51.320000
      Pretty rad.
   Segment 35
      0:01:51.320000 ---> 0:01:55.400000
      General-purpose heat source modules rely on the radioactive decay of plutonium, and they've
   Segment 36
      0:01:55.400000 ---> 0:01:57.640000
      been used frequently in NASA missions.
   Segment 37
      0:01:57.640000 ---> 0:02:01.600000
      But the US hasn't launched a nuclear fission reactor since 1965.
   Segment 38
      0:02:01.600000 ---> 0:02:05.880000
      For the last few years though, they've been revisiting fission with their KiloPower project,
   Segment 39
      0:02:05.880000 ---> 0:02:10.120000
      an effort to find affordable nuclear fission systems that could provide the increased power
   Segment 40
      0:02:10.120000 ---> 0:02:12.120000
      needed for space travel.
   Segment 41
      0:02:12.120000 ---> 0:02:16.360000
      KiloPower systems are already being tested, so it's possible a future iteration could
   Segment 42
      0:02:16.360000 ---> 0:02:20.840000
      be used for the nuclear worm bot, which brings us to the question, what's the timeline for
   Segment 43
      0:02:20.840000 ---> 0:02:22.040000
      this project?
   Segment 44
      0:02:22.040000 ---> 0:02:23.880000
      When will the big worm get to fly?
   Segment 45
      0:02:23.880000 ---> 0:02:27.960000
      Well, NASA's Europa Clipper mission is slated for sometime in the 2020s.
   Segment 46
      0:02:27.960000 ---> 0:02:31.640000
      But as of now, that mission only includes an orbiter, and for the tunneling worm to be
   Segment 47
      0:02:31.640000 ---> 0:02:33.960000
      used, there would need to be a lander.
   Segment 48
      0:02:33.960000 ---> 0:02:39
      NASA has hinted at a possible Europa lander mission, but there's nothing concrete yet.
   Segment 49
      0:02:39 ---> 0:02:43.040000
      That being said, the probe was commissioned by NASA, so there's clearly interest in the
   Segment 50
      0:02:43.040000 ---> 0:02:45.160000
      feasibility of a design like this.
   Segment 51
      0:02:45.160000 ---> 0:02:49.560000
      And with the tantalizing possibility of finding life on Europa, it's probably only a matter
   Segment 52
      0:02:49.560000 ---> 0:02:52.120000
      of time before we try to peek under its shell.
   Segment 53
      0:02:52.120000 ---> 0:02:55.480000
      But in the meantime, I guess we can hope a Hollywood director has seen these sketches
   Segment 54
      0:02:55.480000 ---> 0:03:00.520000
      and is going to make a kick-ass sci-fi movie about tunneling alien robots.
   Segment 55
      0:03:00.520000 ---> 0:03:02.360000
      I would definitely watch that.
   Segment 56
      0:03:02.360000 ---> 0:03:05.720000
      Want more videos about insane space mission designs from the Compass team?
   Segment 57
      0:03:05.720000 ---> 0:03:07.160000
      Let us know in the comments.
   Segment 58
      0:03:07.160000 ---> 0:03:09.800000
      As always, thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time on Seeker.

Transcription for Tiny Extremophiles Living in Rocks!.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:08.480000
      In some of the harshest environments on Earth, it seems like some form of life finds a way
   Segment 2
      0:00:08.480000 ---> 0:00:09.480000
      to get by.
   Segment 3
      0:00:09.480000 ---> 0:00:11.080000
      Even inside solid rock.
   Segment 4
      0:00:11.080000 ---> 0:00:15.720000
      All kinds of tiny organisms, like bacteria, algae, fungi, or archaea, actually live in
   Segment 5
      0:00:15.720000 ---> 0:00:17.720000
      between the grains of rocks and minerals.
   Segment 6
      0:00:17.720000 ---> 0:00:22.200000
      We call them endoliths, from the Greek words meaning inside and rock.
   Segment 7
      0:00:22.200000 ---> 0:00:25.800000
      Endoliths could survive in friendlier environments, but everything else vying for space and
   Segment 8
      0:00:25.800000 ---> 0:00:27.320000
      resources would probably win.
   Segment 9
      0:00:27.320000 ---> 0:00:29.840000
      So they're considered extremophiles.
   Segment 10
      0:00:29.840000 ---> 0:00:33.680000
      Things that can live where nobody else can, and thrive when things get tough.
   Segment 11
      0:00:33.680000 ---> 0:00:36.920000
      One place where endoliths rule is in the cold desert of Antarctica.
   Segment 12
      0:00:36.920000 ---> 0:00:39.840000
      Temperatures can plummet to negative 60 degrees Celsius.
   Segment 13
      0:00:39.840000 ---> 0:00:43.680000
      Winds can blow over 200 kilometers per hour, and the air is super dry.
   Segment 14
      0:00:43.680000 ---> 0:00:46.600000
      For scientists researching there, it's like a hostile alien world.
   Segment 15
      0:00:46.600000 ---> 0:00:50.560000
      But crypto-endoliths hidden in rocks on the Earth's surface like it just fine.
   Segment 16
      0:00:50.560000 ---> 0:00:54.080000
      Crack open a porous rock like sandstone, and just a millimeter below the surface, you
   Segment 17
      0:00:54.080000 ---> 0:00:56.960000
      might find a grayish-greenish layer of microorganisms.
   Segment 18
      0:00:56.960000 ---> 0:01:01.140000
      That could be lichen, which is a mixture of fungus and photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria
   Segment 19
      0:01:01.140000 ---> 0:01:03.520000
      cells that work together to survive.
   Segment 20
      0:01:03.520000 ---> 0:01:06.640000
      Or it could just be bacteria, or it could just be algae.
   Segment 21
      0:01:06.640000 ---> 0:01:10.320000
      Horrors in the sandstone let in a little sunlight and some water from melted snow,
   Segment 22
      0:01:10.320000 ---> 0:01:12.240000
      which the endoliths use to photosynthesize.
   Segment 23
      0:01:12.240000 ---> 0:01:16.080000
      That way, the rock keeps them protected from the worst of the Antarctic conditions.
   Segment 24
      0:01:16.080000 ---> 0:01:20.400000
      And even though a lot of the year is suffering in the cold, dry darkness, they can make just
   Segment 25
      0:01:20.400000 ---> 0:01:22.240000
      enough energy to live and reproduce.
   Segment 26
      0:01:22.240000 ---> 0:01:26.320000
      A couple thousand kilometers away in South Africa, endoliths have stake to claim in another
   Segment 27
      0:01:26.400000 ---> 0:01:29.360000
      extreme environment, the hot depths of the Earth's crust.
   Segment 28
      0:01:29.360000 ---> 0:01:33.440000
      Deep within gold mines, where the temperature of the rock reaches 60 degrees Celsius, the
   Segment 29
      0:01:33.440000 ---> 0:01:37.320000
      air pressure is double that of sea level, and workers are supplied with fresh air from
   Segment 30
      0:01:37.320000 ---> 0:01:40.880000
      the surface for oxygen, scientists found bacteria.
   Segment 31
      0:01:40.880000 ---> 0:01:45.560000
      One species of rod-shaped bacteria was hiding out nearly three kilometers down in a mine,
   Segment 32
      0:01:45.560000 ---> 0:01:49.400000
      and has possibly lived without contact with the surface for millions of years.
   Segment 33
      0:01:49.400000 ---> 0:01:53.760000
      These deep biosphere endoliths are really far from sunlight and get their energy through
   Segment 34
      0:01:53.760000 ---> 0:01:56.080000
      chemical reactions, or chemosynthesis.
   Segment 35
      0:01:56.080000 ---> 0:02:00.080000
      The researchers who found this bacterium think it survives by recycling dead cells,
   Segment 36
      0:02:00.080000 ---> 0:02:04.720000
      absorbing nutrients from rock, and getting carbon from gases, like carbon dioxide or carbon
   Segment 37
      0:02:04.720000 ---> 0:02:05.720000
      monoxide.
   Segment 38
      0:02:05.720000 ---> 0:02:09.600000
      Plus, radiation from deep in the rocks can break down water molecules that seep into
   Segment 39
      0:02:09.600000 ---> 0:02:10.600000
      the mine.
   Segment 40
      0:02:10.600000 ---> 0:02:15.080000
      This creates hydrogen atoms, which these bacteria can react with sulfate compounds to make energy.
   Segment 41
      0:02:15.080000 ---> 0:02:19.080000
      Endoliths can even survive in the rock hundreds of meters beneath the ocean floor.
   Segment 42
      0:02:19.080000 ---> 0:02:23.320000
      Specialized research ships have deep-sea drilling projects where they analyze cores of sediment
   Segment 43
      0:02:23.320000 ---> 0:02:24.440000
      layer by layer.
   Segment 44
      0:02:24.440000 ---> 0:02:27.760000
      One group of scientists found some bacteria that they think were tunneling through volcanic
   Segment 45
      0:02:27.760000 ---> 0:02:32.160000
      silica-containing rock, absorbing nutrients from the minerals, and carbon compounds from
   Segment 46
      0:02:32.160000 ---> 0:02:33.160000
      the seawater.
   Segment 47
      0:02:33.160000 ---> 0:02:37.080000
      Others were found in fractured basalt rock, and might use chemicals like sulfides, nitrates,
   Segment 48
      0:02:37.080000 ---> 0:02:39.600000
      and carbon dioxide, kind of like the bacteria from the goldmine.
   Segment 49
      0:02:39.600000 ---> 0:02:43.360000
      Like the sediment they were found in, some of these microorganisms may be millions of
   Segment 50
      0:02:43.360000 ---> 0:02:47.120000
      years old, and reproduce once every couple thousand years.
   Segment 51
      0:02:47.120000 ---> 0:02:49.560000
      They're basically living in slow motion.
   Segment 52
      0:02:49.560000 ---> 0:02:53.280000
      Some scientists wonder whether these tiny organisms and their chemical interactions with rock
   Segment 53
      0:02:53.280000 ---> 0:02:56.600000
      and carbon in the deep ocean could affect global climate.
   Segment 54
      0:02:56.600000 ---> 0:03:01.200000
      But wherever we find them, endoliths are helping us discover the limits of how and where life
   Segment 55
      0:03:01.200000 ---> 0:03:02.200000
      can exist.
   Segment 56
      0:03:02.200000 ---> 0:03:05.480000
      They can give us lots of clues about how microorganisms make homes in extreme places here
   Segment 57
      0:03:05.480000 ---> 0:03:06.480000
      on Earth.
   Segment 58
      0:03:06.480000 ---> 0:03:09.120000
      And they can also hint at how life could survive on other planets.
   Segment 59
      0:03:09.120000 ---> 0:03:13.200000
      Today, Mars has very little atmosphere and surface water, but scientists think that endolith-like
   Segment 60
      0:03:13.200000 ---> 0:03:17.200000
      organisms could have been some of the very last life forms, escaping the hostile surface
   Segment 61
      0:03:17.200000 ---> 0:03:19.120000
      by hiding in rocks.
   Segment 62
      0:03:19.120000 ---> 0:03:22.800000
      Endoliths' amazing survival abilities have also fueled speculation about the pan-spirmia
   Segment 63
      0:03:22.800000 ---> 0:03:26.600000
      hypothesis, which is basically the idea that life could hitch a ride between worlds
   Segment 64
      0:03:26.600000 ---> 0:03:28.320000
      on asteroids or meteoroids.
   Segment 65
      0:03:28.320000 ---> 0:03:32.320000
      If endoliths can survive in extreme conditions on Earth by hiding in rocks, maybe they could
   Segment 66
      0:03:32.320000 ---> 0:03:34.200000
      survive in rocks hurtling through space, too.
   Segment 67
      0:03:34.200000 ---> 0:03:37.960000
      And if they can do that, there's a slight possibility that extremophiles are tucked
   Segment 68
      0:03:37.960000 ---> 0:03:40.400000
      all over our universe, waiting to be found.
   Segment 69

      Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow, brought to you by our patrons on Patreon.

      0:03:49.200000 ---> 0:03:53.440000

   Segment 73
      0:03:53.440000 ---> 0:03:57.400000
      We know that it's formed from things like asteroids and comets crashing into each other.
   Segment 74
      0:03:57.400000 ---> 0:04:05.300000
      But one thing we don't know about our planet is that we can't even see the

      Earth.

Transcription for Water - Liquid Awesome# Crash Course Biology #2.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:07.240000
      Hello there! Here at Crash Course HQ we like to start out each day with a nice healthy
   Segment 2
      0:00:07.240000 ---> 0:00:12.920000
      dose of water in all its three forms. It is the only substance on all of our planet
   Segment 3
      0:00:12.920000 ---> 0:00:18.440000
      earth that occurs naturally in solid, liquid and gas forms. And to celebrate this magical
   Segment 4
      0:00:18.440000 ---> 0:00:24.840000
      bond between two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, here today we are going to be celebrating
   Segment 5
      0:00:24.840000 ---> 0:00:30.480000
      the wonderful life-sustaining properties of water. But we're going to do it slightly
   Segment 6
      0:00:30.480000 ---> 0:00:31.840000
      more clothed.
   Segment 7
      0:00:31.840000 ---> 0:00:47.320000
      Oh, much better! We left off here at the Biology Crash Course. We're talking about life.
   Segment 8
      0:00:47.320000 ---> 0:00:52.520000
      And the rather important fact that all life as we know it is dependent upon there being
   Segment 9
      0:00:52.520000 ---> 0:00:56.440000
      water around. So I'm just an astronomer who's always looking out into the universe trying
   Segment 10
      0:00:56.440000 ---> 0:01:00.680000
      to figure out whether there is life elsewhere because that is kind of the most important
   Segment 11
      0:01:00.680000 ---> 0:01:04.600000
      question that we have right now. I'm always getting really excited when they find water
   Segment 12
      0:01:04.600000 ---> 0:01:08.240000
      someplace, particularly liquid water. And this is one reason why I, and so many other
   Segment 13
      0:01:08.240000 ---> 0:01:13.680000
      people geeked out so hard last December when Mars' seven-year-old rover opportunity found
   Segment 14
      0:01:13.680000 ---> 0:01:21
      a 20-inch-long vane of gypsum that was almost certainly deposited by long-term liquid water
   Segment 15
      0:01:21 ---> 0:01:24.800000
      on the surface of Mars. And this was probably billions of years ago, and so it's going
   Segment 16
      0:01:24.800000 ---> 0:01:29.480000
      to be hard to tell whether or not the water that was there resulted in some life. But
   Segment 17
      0:01:29.480000 ---> 0:01:32.520000
      maybe we can't figure that out, and that would be really exciting.
   Segment 18
      0:01:32.520000 ---> 0:01:37.040000
      But why? Why do we think that water is necessary for life? Why does water on other planets get
   Segment 19
      0:01:37.040000 ---> 0:01:38.400000
      us so freaking excited?
   Segment 20
      0:01:38.400000 ---> 0:01:41.760000
      So let's start out by investigating some of the amazing properties of water. In order
   Segment 21
      0:01:41.760000 ---> 0:01:44.480000
      to do that, we're going to have to start out with this.
   Segment 22
      0:01:44.480000 ---> 0:01:49.320000
      The world's most popular molecule, or at least the world's most memorized molecule, we all
   Segment 23
      0:01:49.320000 ---> 0:01:54.480000
      know about it. Good old H2O. Two hydrogens, one oxygen, the hydrogens, each sharing an
   Segment 24
      0:01:54.480000 ---> 0:01:59.360000
      electron with oxygen in what we call a covalent bond. So as you can see, you have drawn my
   Segment 25
      0:01:59.360000 ---> 0:02:04.320000
      water molecule in a particular way, and this is actually the way that it appears. It is
   Segment 26
      0:02:04.320000 ---> 0:02:05.520000
      V-shaped.
   Segment 27
      0:02:05.520000 ---> 0:02:10
      Because this big ol' oxygen atom is a little bit more greedy for electrons, it has a slight
   Segment 28
      0:02:10 ---> 0:02:16.560000
      negative charge, whereas this area here with the hydrogen atoms has a slight positive charge.
   Segment 29
      0:02:16.560000 ---> 0:02:20.840000
      As to this polarity, all water molecules are attracted to one another. So much so that
   Segment 30
      0:02:20.840000 ---> 0:02:24.720000
      they actually stick together, and these are called hydrogen bonds. And we talked about
   Segment 31
      0:02:24.720000 ---> 0:02:25.720000
      them last time.
   Segment 32
      0:02:25.720000 ---> 0:02:29.440000
      But essentially what happens is that the positive pull around those hydrogen atoms bonds to the
   Segment 33
      0:02:29.440000 ---> 0:02:34.280000
      negative pull around the oxygen atoms of a different water molecule. And so it's a weak
   Segment 34
      0:02:34.280000 ---> 0:02:36.200000
      bond. But look, they're bonding.
   Segment 35
      0:02:36.200000 ---> 0:02:40.320000
      Seriously, I cannot overstate the importance of this hydrogen bond. So when your t-shirt
   Segment 36
      0:02:40.320000 ---> 0:02:44.600000
      asks you, what's important about water? Start out with hydrogen bonds, and you should put
   Segment 37
      0:02:44.640000 ---> 0:02:46.880000
      it in all gaps and maybe some sparkles around it.
   Segment 38
      0:02:46.880000 ---> 0:02:50.120000
      One of the cool properties that results from these hydrogen bonds is a high cohesion for
   Segment 39
      0:02:50.120000 ---> 0:02:52.480000
      water, which results in high surface tension.
   Segment 40
      0:02:52.480000 ---> 0:02:56.840000
      Cohesion is the attraction between two like things, like attraction between one molecule
   Segment 41
      0:02:56.840000 ---> 0:02:58.760000
      of water and another molecule of water.
   Segment 42
      0:02:58.760000 ---> 0:03:03.200000
      Water has the highest cohesion of any non-metallic liquid. And you can see this if you put some
   Segment 43
      0:03:03.200000 ---> 0:03:07.640000
      water on some wax paper or some teflon, or something where the water beads up. Like
   Segment 44
      0:03:07.640000 ---> 0:03:10.760000
      the, some leaves of plants do it really well. It's quite cool.
   Segment 45
      0:03:10.760000 ---> 0:03:14.920000
      When water adheres weakly to the wax paper or to the plant, but strongly to itself, the
   Segment 46
      0:03:14.920000 ---> 0:03:18.640000
      water molecules are holding those droplets together in a configuration that creates the
   Segment 47
      0:03:18.640000 ---> 0:03:22.880000
      least amount of surface area. It's this high surface tension that allows some bugs, and
   Segment 48
      0:03:22.880000 ---> 0:03:27.320000
      even I think one lizard, and also one Jesus, to be able to walk on water.
   Segment 49
      0:03:27.320000 ---> 0:03:30.760000
      The cohesive force of water does its limits, of course. There are other substances that
   Segment 50
      0:03:30.760000 ---> 0:03:32.360000
      water quite likes to stick to.
   Segment 51
      0:03:32.360000 ---> 0:03:36.400000
      Take glass, for example. This is called adhesion, and the water is spreading out here instead
   Segment 52
      0:03:36.400000 ---> 0:03:40.600000
      of beating up because the adhesive forces between the water and the glass are stronger
   Segment 53
      0:03:40.600000 ---> 0:03:44.800000
      than the cohesive forces of the individual water molecules in the bead of water. Adhesion
   Segment 54
      0:03:44.800000 ---> 0:03:50
      is attraction between two different substances, so in this case, the water molecules and glass
   Segment 55
      0:03:50 ---> 0:03:54.320000
      molecules. These properties lead to one of my favorite things about water, the fact that
   Segment 56
      0:03:54.320000 ---> 0:03:59.080000
      it can defy gravity. That really cool thing that just happened is called capillary action.
   Segment 57
      0:03:59.080000 ---> 0:04:02.920000
      And explaining it can be easily done with what we now know about cohesion and adhesion.
   Segment 58
      0:04:02.920000 ---> 0:04:07
      Thanks to adhesion, the water molecules are attracted to the molecules in the straw. But
   Segment 59
      0:04:07 ---> 0:04:13
      as the water molecules adhere to the straw, other molecules are drawn in by cohesion following
   Segment 60
      0:04:13 ---> 0:04:14.640000
      those fellow water molecules.
   Segment 61
      0:04:14.640000 ---> 0:04:20
      Thank you cohesion. The surface tension created here causes the water to climb up the straw.
   Segment 62
      0:04:20 ---> 0:04:23.680000
      And it will continue to climb until eventually gravity pulling down on the weight of the
   Segment 63
      0:04:23.680000 ---> 0:04:27.800000
      water in the straw overpowers the surface tension. The fact that water is a polar molecule also
   Segment 64
      0:04:27.800000 ---> 0:04:31.760000
      makes it really good at dissolving things, which we call it's a good solvent then. Scratch
   Segment 65
      0:04:31.760000 ---> 0:04:35
      that, water isn't a good solvent. It's an amazing solvent.
   Segment 66
      0:04:35 ---> 0:04:39.320000
      There are more substances that can be dissolved in water than in any other liquid on earth.
   Segment 67
      0:04:39.320000 ---> 0:04:43.200000
      And yes, that includes the strongest acid that we have ever created. These substances
   Segment 68
      0:04:43.200000 ---> 0:04:48.360000
      that dissolve in water, sugar or salt, being ones that we're familiar with are called
   Segment 69
      0:04:48.360000 ---> 0:04:53.640000
      hydrophilic. And they are hydrophilic because they are polar. And their polarity is stronger
   Segment 70
      0:04:53.640000 ---> 0:04:56.760000
      than the cohesive forces of the water. So when you get one of these polar substances
   Segment 71
      0:04:56.760000 ---> 0:05:01.200000
      in water, it's strong enough that it breaks all the little cohesive forces, all those
   Segment 72
      0:05:01.280000 ---> 0:05:05.840000
      little hydrogen bonds. And instead of hydrogen bonding to each other, the water will hydrogen
   Segment 73
      0:05:05.840000 ---> 0:05:11.240000
      bond around these polar substances. Table salt is ionic. And right now it's being separated
   Segment 74
      0:05:11.240000 ---> 0:05:16.280000
      into ions as the poles of our water molecules interact with it. But what happens when there
   Segment 75
      0:05:16.280000 ---> 0:05:23.280000
      is a molecule that cannot break the cohesive forces of water? It can't penetrate and come
   Segment 76
      0:05:23.920000 ---> 0:05:27.880000
      into it. Basically what happens when that substance can't overcome the strong cohesive
   Segment 77
      0:05:27.880000 ---> 0:05:32.480000
      forces of water and can't get inside of the water. That's when we get what we call
   Segment 78
      0:05:32.480000 ---> 0:05:38.040000
      hydrophobic substance or something that is fearful of water. These molecules lack charged
   Segment 79
      0:05:38.040000 ---> 0:05:42.800000
      poles. They are non-polar and are not dissolving in water because essentially they're being
   Segment 80
      0:05:42.800000 ---> 0:05:47.400000
      pushed out of the water by water's cohesive forces. Water, we may call it the universal
   Segment 81
      0:05:47.400000 ---> 0:05:50.160000
      solvent, but that does not mean that it dissolves everything.
   Segment 82
      0:05:50.160000 ---> 0:05:59.560000
      There have been a lot of eccentric scientists throughout history, but all this talk about
   Segment 83
      0:05:59.560000 ---> 0:06:04.200000
      water got me thinking about perhaps the most eccentric of the eccentrics, a man named
   Segment 84
      0:06:04.200000 ---> 0:06:09.080000
      Henry Cavendish. He communicated with his female servants only via notes and added a
   Segment 85
      0:06:09.080000 ---> 0:06:14.080000
      staircase to the back of his house to avoid contact with his housekeeper. Some believe
   Segment 86
      0:06:14.080000 ---> 0:06:18.480000
      he may have suffered from a form of autism, but just about everyone will admit that he
   Segment 87
      0:06:18.520000 ---> 0:06:24.480000
      was a scientific genius. He's best remembered as the first person to recognize hydrogen gas
   Segment 88
      0:06:24.480000 ---> 0:06:30.320000
      as a distinct substance and to determine the composition of water. In the 1700s, most people
   Segment 89
      0:06:30.320000 ---> 0:06:34.840000
      thought that water itself was an element, but Cavendish observed that hydrogen, which
   Segment 90
      0:06:34.840000 ---> 0:06:40.480000
      he called inflamable air, reacted with oxygen known then by the awesome name Deflostigated
   Segment 91
      0:06:40.480000 ---> 0:06:45.360000
      Air to form water. Cavendish didn't totally understand what he discovered here in part
   Segment 92
      0:06:45.360000 ---> 0:06:49.360000
      because he didn't believe in chemical compounds and he explained his experiments with hydrogen
   Segment 93
      0:06:49.360000 ---> 0:06:55.120000
      in terms of a fire-like element called flogiston. Nevertheless, his experiments were groundbreaking.
   Segment 94
      0:06:55.120000 ---> 0:06:58.720000
      Like his work in determining the specific gravity, basically the comparative density
   Segment 95
      0:06:58.720000 ---> 0:07:03.040000
      of hydrogen and other gases with reference to common air, it's especially impressive
   Segment 96
      0:07:03.040000 ---> 0:07:07.360000
      when you consider the crude instruments he was working with. This, for example, is what
   Segment 97
      0:07:07.360000 ---> 0:07:11.920000
      he made his hydrogen gas with. He went on not only to establish an accurate composition
   Segment 98
      0:07:11.920000 ---> 0:07:16
      of the atmosphere, but also discovered the density of the earth. Not bad for a guy who
   Segment 99
      0:07:16 ---> 0:07:19.920000
      was so painfully shy that the only existing portrait of him was sketched without his knowledge.
   Segment 100
      0:07:19.920000 ---> 0:07:23.600000
      But for all of his decades of experiments, Cavendish only published about 20 papers.
   Segment 101
      0:07:23.600000 ---> 0:07:27.920000
      In the years after his death, researchers figured out that Cavendish had actually pre-discovered
   Segment 102
      0:07:27.920000 ---> 0:07:34.640000
      Richter's Law, Olm's Law, Coulomb's Law, several other laws. That's a lot of freakin' laws.
   Segment 103
      0:07:34.640000 ---> 0:07:39.760000
      And if he had gotten credit for them all, we would have had to deal with like Cavendish's
   Segment 104
      0:07:39.840000 ---> 0:07:46.160000
      8th Law and Cavendish's 4th Law. So I, for one, am glad that he didn't actually get credit.
   Segment 105
      0:07:46.160000 ---> 0:07:49.040000
      We're gonna do some pretty amazing science right now. You guys are not gonna believe this.
   Segment 106
      0:07:49.600000 ---> 0:07:50.400000
      Okay, you ready?
   Segment 107
      0:07:52.560000 ---> 0:07:58.640000
      It floats! Yeah, I know you're not surprised by this, but you should be, because everything else
   Segment 108
      0:07:58.640000 ---> 0:08:04.400000
      when it's solid is much more dense than when it's liquid, just like gases are much less dense than
   Segment 109
      0:08:04.400000 ---> 0:08:09.520000
      liquids are. But that simple characteristic of water that its solid form floats is one of the
   Segment 110
      0:08:09.520000 ---> 0:08:15.760000
      reasons why life on this planet, as we know it, is possible. And why is it that solid water
   Segment 111
      0:08:15.760000 ---> 0:08:20.240000
      is less dense than liquid water, while everything else is the exact opposite of that? Well,
   Segment 112
      0:08:20.240000 ---> 0:08:25.680000
      you can thank your hydrogen bonds once again. So at around 32 degrees Fahrenheit, or zero degrees
   Segment 113
      0:08:25.680000 ---> 0:08:30.960000
      Celsius, if you're a scientist or from a part of the world where things make sense, water molecules
   Segment 114
      0:08:30.960000 ---> 0:08:35.840000
      start to solidify, and the hydrogen bonds in those water molecules form crystalline structures
   Segment 115
      0:08:35.840000 ---> 0:08:42.880000
      that space molecules apart more evenly, in turn making frozen water less dense than its liquid form.
   Segment 116
      0:08:42.880000 ---> 0:08:47.280000
      So at almost every circumstance, floating water ice is a really good thing. If ice were denser
   Segment 117
      0:08:47.280000 ---> 0:08:50.960000
      than water, it would freeze and then sink, and then freeze and then sink, and then freeze and then
   Segment 118
      0:08:50.960000 ---> 0:08:54.960000
      sink. So just trust me on this one, you don't want to live on a world where ice sinks. Not only would
   Segment 119
      0:08:54.960000 ---> 0:09:00
      it totally wreak havoc on aquatic ecosystem, which are basically how life formed on the earth in
   Segment 120
      0:09:00 ---> 0:09:04.560000
      the first place. It would also, you know, all the ice in the North Pole would sink, and then
   Segment 121
      0:09:05.360000 ---> 0:09:10.800000
      all of the water everywhere else would rise, and we wouldn't have any land. That would be annoying.
   Segment 122
      0:09:10.800000 ---> 0:09:17.360000
      There's one more amazing property of water that I'm forgetting. So why is it so hot in here?
   Segment 123
      0:09:17.920000 ---> 0:09:24.240000
      Ah, heat capacity. Yes, water has a very high heat capacity, and probably that means nothing to
   Segment 124
      0:09:24.320000 ---> 0:09:30.240000
      you, but basically it means that water is really good at holding on to heat, which is why we like
   Segment 125
      0:09:30.240000 ---> 0:09:36.240000
      to put hot water bottles in our bed and cuddle with them when we're lonely. But aside from
   Segment 126
      0:09:36.240000 ---> 0:09:41.600000
      artificially warming your bed, it's also very important that it's hard to heat up and cool
   Segment 127
      0:09:41.600000 ---> 0:09:47.360000
      down the oceans significantly. They become giant heat sinks that regulate the temperature and
   Segment 128
      0:09:47.360000 ---> 0:09:52.400000
      the climate of our planet, which is why, for example, it's so much nicer in Los Angeles,
   Segment 129
      0:09:52.400000 ---> 0:09:57.280000
      where the ocean is constantly keeping the temperatures the same than it is in, say,
   Segment 130
      0:09:57.280000 ---> 0:10:02.480000
      Nebraska. On a smaller scale, we can see water's high heat capacity really easily and visually by
   Segment 131
      0:10:02.480000 ---> 0:10:08.720000
      putting a pot with no water in it on a stove and seeing how badly that goes. But then you put a
   Segment 132
      0:10:08.720000 ---> 0:10:13.040000
      little bit of water in it, and it takes forever to freakin' boil. Oh, and if you haven't already
   Segment 133
      0:10:13.040000 ---> 0:10:19.200000
      noticed this, or when water evaporates from your skin, it cools you down. Now, that's the principle
   Segment 134
      0:10:19.200000 ---> 0:10:23.600000
      behind sweating, which is an extremely effective, though somewhat embarrassing part of life. But
   Segment 135
      0:10:23.600000 ---> 0:10:28.640000
      this is an example of another incredibly cool thing about water. When my body gets hot and it sweats,
   Segment 136
      0:10:28.640000 ---> 0:10:32.720000
      that heat excites some of the water molecules on my skin to the point where they break those
   Segment 137
      0:10:32.720000 ---> 0:10:38.800000
      hydrogen bonds and they evaporate away. And when they escape, they take that heat energy with them,
   Segment 138
      0:10:38.800000 ---> 0:10:44.160000
      leaving me cooler. Lovely. Well, this wasn't exercise, though. I don't know why sweating so much. It
   Segment 139
      0:10:44.160000 ---> 0:10:48.160000
      could be the spray bottle that I keep spraying myself with, or maybe it's just because this is
   Segment 140
      0:10:48.160000 ---> 0:10:52.720000
      such a high stress enterprise trying to teach you people things. I think I need some water, but
   Segment 141
      0:10:52.720000 ---> 0:10:59.200000
      while I'm drinking, there's a review for all of the things that we talked about today. If you,
   Segment 142
      0:10:59.920000 ---> 0:11:02.960000
      there are a couple things that you're not quite sure about, just go back and watch them. It's not
   Segment 143
      0:11:02.960000 ---> 0:11:07.040000
      gonna take a lot of your time, and you're gonna be smarter, I promise. You're gonna do so well on
   Segment 144
      0:11:07.040000 ---> 0:11:11.120000
      that test you either don't, or do you have coming up? Okay, bye.

Transcription for What caused the Cambrian explosion#.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:15.460000
      A mere 542 million years ago, the Earth's landscape was a barren wilderness.
   Segment 2
      0:00:15.460000 ---> 0:00:20.040000
      Four billion years after the planet's creation, no animals lived on the land.
   Segment 3
      0:00:20.040000 ---> 0:00:24.960000
      The most developed organisms were simple animals living in the oceans.
   Segment 4
      0:00:24.960000 ---> 0:00:28.360000
      Something extraordinary was happening in the seas.
   Segment 5
      0:00:28.360000 ---> 0:00:32.240000
      For a period of 20 million years at the beginning of a period called the Cambrian,
   Segment 6
      0:00:32.240000 ---> 0:00:36.280000
      an explosion of new animals developed below the water's surface.
   Segment 7
      0:00:36.280000 ---> 0:00:42.280000
      These later gave rise to most of the diversity of animal life that now exists on Earth.
   Segment 8
      0:00:42.280000 ---> 0:00:46.760000
      But the cause of this sudden burst of life, which geologists call the Cambrian explosion,
   Segment 9
      0:00:46.760000 ---> 0:00:49.120000
      remains a mystery.
   Segment 10
      0:00:49.120000 ---> 0:00:52.480000
      The Cambrian explosion was really biology's big bang.
   Segment 11
      0:00:52.480000 ---> 0:00:57.720000
      Things went from moving very slowly along the sea floor without any predation, to suddenly
   Segment 12
      0:00:57.720000 ---> 0:01:00.680000
      all the different type of ecologies that we find today.
   Segment 13
      0:01:00.680000 ---> 0:01:04.080000
      Life literally exploded.
   Segment 14
      0:01:04.080000 ---> 0:01:05.920000
      What triggered the Cambrian explosion?
   Segment 15
      0:01:05.920000 ---> 0:01:06.920000
      We don't really know.
   Segment 16
      0:01:06.920000 ---> 0:01:09.840000
      There are many different possibilities, different hypotheses, and we've got to remember that
   Segment 17
      0:01:09.840000 ---> 0:01:13.640000
      cause and effect are often difficult to disentangle.
   Segment 18
      0:01:13.640000 ---> 0:01:16.080000
      So what happened exactly?
   Segment 19
      0:01:16.080000 ---> 0:01:19.440000
      To try to understand it, you need to look a little bit farther back in the history of
   Segment 20
      0:01:19.440000 ---> 0:01:23.760000
      the Earth to the Ediacran period, which preceded the Cambrian.
   Segment 21
      0:01:23.760000 ---> 0:01:29.560000
      It was during this time that the first large animals evolved, but they were shellless.
   Segment 22
      0:01:29.560000 ---> 0:01:33.800000
      Before the Cambrian, we go into what's called the Ediacran times.
   Segment 23
      0:01:33.800000 ---> 0:01:40.120000
      And this is an extraordinary interval where we have the sea floor populated by basically
   Segment 24
      0:01:40.120000 ---> 0:01:41.120000
      weird creatures.
   Segment 25
      0:01:41.120000 ---> 0:01:46.240000
      And quite frankly, we're not quite sure whether animals are something else entirely.
   Segment 26
      0:01:46.240000 ---> 0:01:52.480000
      These are organisms which seem to have mostly survived on absorbing nutrients from the sea
   Segment 27
      0:01:52.480000 ---> 0:01:53.480000
      water itself.
   Segment 28
      0:01:53.480000 ---> 0:01:55.360000
      We may not have had any gut.
   Segment 29
      0:01:55.360000 ---> 0:01:57.320000
      Some of them may be able to move.
   Segment 30
      0:01:57.320000 ---> 0:01:59.720000
      These creatures are principally soft-bodied.
   Segment 31
      0:01:59.720000 ---> 0:02:01.480000
      That is a no-skeleton.
   Segment 32
      0:02:01.480000 ---> 0:02:06.680000
      And then they seem to more or less disappear as the Cambrian explosion kicks off.
   Segment 33
      0:02:06.680000 ---> 0:02:11.880000
      After 45 million years of slow evolution, those weird creatures suddenly disappeared
   Segment 34
      0:02:11.880000 ---> 0:02:15.280000
      to be replaced by those of the Cambrian.
   Segment 35
      0:02:15.280000 ---> 0:02:19.680000
      The first echinoderms appeared 540 million years ago.
   Segment 36
      0:02:19.680000 ---> 0:02:22.680000
      Starfish and sea urchins are their descendants.
   Segment 37
      0:02:22.680000 ---> 0:02:26.080000
      The Kia pods followed after some 10 million years.
   Segment 38
      0:02:26.080000 ---> 0:02:31.480000
      The trilobite, the Cambrian's most iconic fossil, joined the explosion towards its end.
   Segment 39
      0:02:31.480000 ---> 0:02:34.880000
      It showed up a few million years later.
   Segment 40
      0:02:34.880000 ---> 0:02:40.040000
      There are a number of theories about what happened that enabled these creatures to appear.
   Segment 41
      0:02:40.040000 ---> 0:02:51.600000
      There is a theory I had processes suggesting that one of the factors that hold him back
   Segment 42
      0:02:51.600000 ---> 0:02:56.920000
      to the evolution of the animal is the availability of oxygen.
   Segment 43
      0:02:56.920000 ---> 0:03:05.520000
      For the synthesizers, things like cyanobacteria, algae, plants make oxygen and organic carbon.
   Segment 44
      0:03:05.520000 ---> 0:03:12.320000
      And once the organic carbon is buried in the sediment, the oxygen is released in the ocean
   Segment 45
      0:03:12.320000 ---> 0:03:17.040000
      and in the atmosphere for animals to use.
   Segment 46
      0:03:17.040000 ---> 0:03:21.360000
      Compared to the Cambrian explosion, oxygen levels may have been too low for large active
   Segment 47
      0:03:21.360000 ---> 0:03:23.160000
      animals to survive.
   Segment 48
      0:03:23.160000 ---> 0:03:29.160000
      But once those levels increased, larger animals were able to survive and proliferate.
   Segment 49
      0:03:29.160000 ---> 0:03:36.480000
      Then animals burst and are diversified in many, many different forms.
   Segment 50
      0:03:36.480000 ---> 0:03:41.320000
      Evidence to support this theory of higher oxygen levels is scarce, but there may be a link
   Segment 51
      0:03:41.320000 ---> 0:03:44.400000
      to a phenomenon called snowball earth.
   Segment 52
      0:03:44.400000 ---> 0:03:47.080000
      This was a long period of recurrent ice ages.
   Segment 53
      0:03:47.080000 ---> 0:03:52.640000
      When the glaciers melted, huge amounts of rock were exposed and eroded, pouring nutrients
   Segment 54
      0:03:52.640000 ---> 0:03:54.080000
      into the water.
   Segment 55
      0:03:54.080000 ---> 0:03:58.240000
      That encouraged the growth of photosynthetic algae, which would have caused oxygen levels
   Segment 56
      0:03:58.240000 ---> 0:04:00.360000
      to rise.
   Segment 57
      0:04:00.360000 ---> 0:04:06.040000
      But the last of the giant ice ages ended around 90 million years before the Cambrian.
   Segment 58
      0:04:06.040000 ---> 0:04:10.920000
      Things like oxygen levels, which are fairly clearly increasing during this interval, close
   Segment 59
      0:04:10.920000 ---> 0:04:13.760000
      to the Cambrian explosion, must have been important.
   Segment 60
      0:04:13.760000 ---> 0:04:18.760000
      But oxygen was accumulating already much, much before then.
   Segment 61
      0:04:18.760000 ---> 0:04:22.880000
      Another theory for why the Cambrian explosion occurred is that minerals became increasingly
   Segment 62
      0:04:22.880000 ---> 0:04:26.640000
      available in the oceans due to postglacial erosion.
   Segment 63
      0:04:26.640000 ---> 0:04:29.640000
      These could have been used for the construction of shells.
   Segment 64
      0:04:29.640000 ---> 0:04:32.680000
      But Cambrian shells were made from a range of materials.
   Segment 65
      0:04:32.680000 ---> 0:04:36.840000
      This suggests that they were the result of parallel evolution in different animal lines,
   Segment 66
      0:04:36.840000 ---> 0:04:42.120000
      not a single innovation.
   Segment 67
      0:04:42.120000 ---> 0:04:46.520000
      That means something encouraged them to develop on more than one occasion, and shells
   Segment 68
      0:04:46.520000 ---> 0:04:48.120000
      are costly to make.
   Segment 69
      0:04:48.120000 ---> 0:04:52.360000
      Its unlikely mere abundance of minerals would have been enough.
   Segment 70
      0:04:52.360000 ---> 0:04:56.800000
      Could a transformative innovation in the animals themselves be the explanation?
   Segment 71
      0:04:56.800000 ---> 0:05:01.600000
      One such innovation could be bilateral symmetry, which concentrates nerves and sense organs
   Segment 72
      0:05:01.600000 ---> 0:05:06
      at an animal's front, and encourages the development of an efficient gut with a mouth
   Segment 73
      0:05:06 ---> 0:05:11.080000
      and an anus.
   Segment 74
      0:05:11.080000 ---> 0:05:14.640000
      They are inventing nervous systems, inventing eyes and other sensory systems.
   Segment 75
      0:05:14.640000 ---> 0:05:17.960000
      We are learning how to move fast, how to swim effectively.
   Segment 76
      0:05:17.960000 ---> 0:05:23.600000
      So you have a cascade of feedbacks, and it's really trying to pinpoint if you like the trigger
   Segment 77
      0:05:23.600000 ---> 0:05:29.160000
      versus all the other consequences which flowed from that initial point.
   Segment 78
      0:05:29.160000 ---> 0:05:35.640000
      The Cambrian explosion happens after a series of events, in my opinion.
   Segment 79
      0:05:35.720000 ---> 0:05:41.240000
      First, you need to have genetic building blocks to make an animal.
   Segment 80
      0:05:41.240000 ---> 0:05:47.840000
      You also need oxygen to support animals, to support animal metabolism.
   Segment 81
      0:05:47.840000 ---> 0:05:51.240000
      But that alone is not sufficient either.
   Segment 82
      0:05:51.240000 ---> 0:05:57.720000
      You also need a mechanism to drive the system into a runaway situation.
   Segment 83
      0:05:57.720000 ---> 0:06:04.120000
      You need to make the system work very fast, and a one of the mechanisms to drive the system
   Segment 84
      0:06:04.120000 ---> 0:06:10.400000
      into a runaway situation is ecological feedback.
   Segment 85
      0:06:10.400000 ---> 0:06:15.520000
      Ecological feedback, in this sense, refers to the interaction between predator and prey.
   Segment 86
      0:06:15.520000 ---> 0:06:20.760000
      During the Cambrian, predators evolved new mechanisms, such as vision, to track down their lunch.
   Segment 87
      0:06:20.760000 ---> 0:06:26.440000
      A good part of what's happening in the Cambrian explosion must be the motor of ecological change,
   Segment 88
      0:06:26.440000 ---> 0:06:33.520000
      and one of the really big important gear changes, so to speak, to pursue that analogy is in
   Segment 89
      0:06:33.520000 ---> 0:06:36.920000
      a way in which predators and prey interact.
   Segment 90
      0:06:36.920000 ---> 0:06:42.160000
      Part of the explanation for the widespread development of skeletons must be the rise of predators,
   Segment 91
      0:06:42.160000 ---> 0:06:46.720000
      and we see other evidence in terms of mouth parts, even gut content sometimes.
   Segment 92
      0:06:46.720000 ---> 0:06:48.920000
      You can see what one animal has swallowed.
   Segment 93
      0:06:48.920000 ---> 0:06:56.520000
      All these things suggest that we are moving into an ecology which is radically different from anything ever before.
   Segment 94
      0:06:56.520000 ---> 0:06:59.920000
      An integral part of this is the evolution of nervous systems.
   Segment 95
      0:06:59.920000 ---> 0:07:25.700000
      A nervous system, of course, includes outer-
   Segment 96
      0:07:25.700000 ---> 0:07:28.500000
      sides with the start of the Cambrian explosion.
   Segment 97
      0:07:28.500000 ---> 0:07:35.100000
      Possibly could indicate that vision was actually the only thing that was required to trigger the Cambrian explosion.
   Segment 98
      0:07:35.100000 ---> 0:07:40.500000
      Light today is the most powerful stimulus of all, and vision is the most powerful sense.
   Segment 99
      0:07:40.500000 ---> 0:07:45.900000
      When that's unleashed on the world for the first time, it's going to create chaos.
   Segment 100
      0:07:45.900000 ---> 0:07:51.700000
      Now, the capability to sense light has been there for a long time.
   Segment 101
      0:07:51.900000 ---> 0:07:55.300000
      Even some bacteria have a way to sense light.
   Segment 102
      0:07:55.300000 ---> 0:08:02.300000
      Many microorganisms have a way to sense light, but with very complex eyes,
   Segment 103
      0:08:02.300000 ---> 0:08:06.700000
      they can very precisely position the prey, they can view three dimensions,
   Segment 104
      0:08:06.700000 ---> 0:08:10.900000
      and allow the predators to very effectively catch the prey.
   Segment 105
      0:08:10.900000 ---> 0:08:20.700000
      That's a very important part of the ecological feedback that allows the Cambrian explosion to happen in a very rapid rate.
   Segment 106
      0:08:20.700000 ---> 0:08:24.700000
      Now we had this pinpoint accuracy, a predator could spot a prey,
   Segment 107
      0:08:24.700000 ---> 0:08:28.700000
      and also because it's got its fast swimming parts and hard parts itself,
   Segment 108
      0:08:28.700000 ---> 0:08:31.300000
      it could get to that animal instantly and tear it apart.
   Segment 109
      0:08:31.300000 ---> 0:08:37.700000
      So that means now there's huge selection pressures on all those soft bodies' animals to evolve defenses against this,
   Segment 110
      0:08:37.700000 ---> 0:08:45.700000
      which means really hard parts, it means shields and spines, and also hard swimming parts to swim away itself.
   Segment 111
      0:08:45.700000 ---> 0:08:47.700000
      But not everyone agrees.
   Segment 112
      0:08:47.700000 ---> 0:08:52.700000
      Now there's absolutely no doubt that eyes did evolve as part of the Cambrian explosion.
   Segment 113
      0:08:52.700000 ---> 0:08:56.700000
      My reservation with it is that eyes come in all sorts of shapes and forms,
   Segment 114
      0:08:56.700000 ---> 0:08:59.700000
      and primitive eyes are really little more than what we call ice spots.
   Segment 115
      0:08:59.700000 ---> 0:09:03.700000
      They're sensitive really to sort of shades of grey and white, and no more than that,
   Segment 116
      0:09:03.700000 ---> 0:09:05.700000
      and that's quite sufficient for the great majority of animals.
   Segment 117
      0:09:05.700000 ---> 0:09:08.700000
      They don't actually make an image on their eye.
   Segment 118
      0:09:08.700000 ---> 0:09:13.700000
      Whereas I think one of the dangers, if I may say so, is seeing evolution through our eyes,
   Segment 119
      0:09:13.700000 ---> 0:09:18.700000
      is we have fantastically well adapted eyes, which are the product of millions of years of evolution,
   Segment 120
      0:09:18.700000 ---> 0:09:23.700000
      and there's little doubt that those really sophisticated eyes only evolve a bit later.
   Segment 121
      0:09:26.700000 ---> 0:09:29.700000
      There is one other possibility.
   Segment 122
      0:09:29.700000 ---> 0:09:35.700000
      The disappearance of the Ediacan creatures may be the cause, not the consequence of the Cambrian explosion.
   Segment 123
      0:09:35.700000 ---> 0:09:39.700000
      The explosion resembles the recovery from a mass extinction.
   Segment 124
      0:09:40.700000 ---> 0:09:46.700000
      Signs of a catastrophe 542 million years ago could easily have vanished by now,
   Segment 125
      0:09:46.700000 ---> 0:09:49.700000
      but that doesn't mean one didn't happen.
   Segment 126
      0:09:49.700000 ---> 0:09:55.700000
      Perhaps the bilateral ancestors of today's animals were simply hiding in the shadows of the Ediacan world
   Segment 127
      0:09:55.700000 ---> 0:09:58.700000
      until opportunity knocked.
   Segment 128
      0:09:58.700000 ---> 0:10:02.700000
      Whatever actually did happen though, they took that opportunity,
   Segment 129
      0:10:02.700000 ---> 0:10:05.700000
      with momentous consequences for the future.
   Segment 130
      0:10:06.700000 ---> 0:10:09.700000
      Humans are direct descendants of the Cambrian explosion.
   Segment 131
      0:10:09.700000 ---> 0:10:13.700000
      We have primitive fish from deposits such as a birdger shell in Canada,
   Segment 132
      0:10:13.700000 ---> 0:10:16.700000
      which we can really say are our ancestors.
   Segment 133
      0:10:16.700000 ---> 0:10:20.700000
      From the human point of view, the true significance of the Cambrian explosion
   Segment 134
      0:10:20.700000 ---> 0:10:24.700000
      is that homo sapiens wouldn't be here if it hadn't happened.

Transcription for What Is The Habitable Zone#.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:04.880000
      I know, the weather in your hometown is downright uninhabitable.
   Segment 2
      0:00:04.880000 ---> 0:00:11.160000
      The scorching heat waves and the annual typhoonic deluges and snow deep enough to bury a corn
   Segment 3
      0:00:11.160000 ---> 0:00:12.160000
      silo.
   Segment 4
      0:00:12.160000 ---> 0:00:18.400000
      The bad news is Planet Earth is the only habitable place we know of in the entire universe.
   Segment 5
      0:00:18.400000 ---> 0:00:22.800000
      Also, the Niberian suffering from Niberian made climate change?
   Segment 6
      0:00:22.800000 ---> 0:00:25.440000
      Only Niberian algore can answer that question.
   Segment 7
      0:00:25.440000 ---> 0:00:31.880000
      We as a species are interested in habitability for an assortment of reasons, political, financial,
   Segment 8
      0:00:31.880000 ---> 0:00:33.880000
      humanitarian and scientific.
   Segment 9
      0:00:33.880000 ---> 0:00:38.780000
      We will understand how our own climate is changing, how we will live in the climate
   Segment 10
      0:00:38.780000 ---> 0:00:44.400000
      of the future and what we can do to stem the tide of what our carbon consumption causes.
   Segment 11
      0:00:44.400000 ---> 0:00:48.800000
      There could be a genesis to push for cleaner energy sources or driving politicians towards
   Segment 12
      0:00:48.800000 ---> 0:00:52.960000
      climate change denial to maintain nefarious financial gain.
   Segment 13
      0:00:52.960000 ---> 0:00:59.200000
      We also might need a new lily pad to jump to, assuming we can sort out the travel obstacles.
   Segment 14
      0:00:59.200000 ---> 0:01:04.880000
      The thing that interests me personally the most is, when can I see an alien?
   Segment 15
      0:01:04.880000 ---> 0:01:10.360000
      The habitable zone, also known as the Goldilocks zone, is the region around a star where the
   Segment 16
      0:01:10.360000 ---> 0:01:15.600000
      average temperature on a planet allows for liquid water with which to make porridge.
   Segment 17
      0:01:15.600000 ---> 0:01:21.520000
      It's that liquid water that we hunt for, not only for our future uses, but as an indicator
   Segment 18
      0:01:21.520000 ---> 0:01:25.440000
      of where alien life could be in the universe.
   Segment 19
      0:01:25.440000 ---> 0:01:28.680000
      Pauldens outside this range are pretty obvious.
   Segment 20
      0:01:28.680000 ---> 0:01:29.680000
      Too hot.
   Segment 21
      0:01:29.680000 ---> 0:01:35.040000
      It's a perpetual steam bath, where it produces separate piles of hydrogen and oxygen and
   Segment 22
      0:01:35.040000 ---> 0:01:39.480000
      then your oxygen combines with carbon to form carbon dioxide and then the hydrogen just
   Segment 23
      0:01:39.480000 ---> 0:01:40.960000
      buggers off into space.
   Segment 24
      0:01:40.960000 ---> 0:01:42.680000
      This is what happened with Venus.
   Segment 25
      0:01:42.680000 ---> 0:01:47
      If the planet is too cold, then bodies of water are solid skating rinks.
   Segment 26
      0:01:47.480000 ---> 0:01:52.280000
      There could be pockets of liquid water deep beneath the icy surface, but overall, they're
   Segment 27
      0:01:52.280000 ---> 0:01:53.360000
      bad places to live.
   Segment 28
      0:01:53.360000 ---> 0:01:57.760000
      We got this on Mars and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.
   Segment 29
      0:01:57.760000 ---> 0:02:01.400000
      The habitable zone is a rough measurement.
   Segment 30
      0:02:01.400000 ---> 0:02:05.160000
      It's a place where liquid water might exist.
   Segment 31
      0:02:05.160000 ---> 0:02:10.520000
      Unfortunately, it's not just a simple equation of the distance to the star versus the amount
   Segment 32
      0:02:10.520000 ---> 0:02:12.280000
      of energy output.
   Segment 33
      0:02:12.280000 ---> 0:02:15.120000
      The atmosphere of the planet matters a lot.
   Segment 34
      0:02:15.120000 ---> 0:02:21.040000
      In fact, both Venus and Mars are considered to be within the solar system's habitable
   Segment 35
      0:02:21.040000 ---> 0:02:22.360000
      zone.
   Segment 36
      0:02:22.360000 ---> 0:02:26.760000
      The New Zealand atmosphere is so thick with carbon to oxide that it traps energy from
   Segment 37
      0:02:26.760000 ---> 0:02:33
      the sun and creates an inhospitable oven of heat that would quick boil any life faster
   Segment 38
      0:02:33 ---> 0:02:35.400000
      than you can say past the garlic butter.
   Segment 39
      0:02:35.400000 ---> 0:02:37.680000
      It's the opposite on Mars.
   Segment 40
      0:02:37.680000 ---> 0:02:44.080000
      The thin atmosphere won't trap any heat at all, so the planet is bunchillingly cold.
   Segment 41
      0:02:44.120000 ---> 0:02:49.360000
      Upgrade the atmospheres of either planet and you could get worlds which would be perfectly
   Segment 42
      0:02:49.360000 ---> 0:02:51.360000
      reasonable to live on.
   Segment 43
      0:02:51.360000 ---> 0:02:56.400000
      If you bash them together and could spill the atmosphere of one onto the other, tell
   Segment 44
      0:02:56.400000 ---> 0:03:00.360000
      Blackbolt to ring up Franklin Richards, I have an idea.
   Segment 45
      0:03:00.360000 ---> 0:03:05.960000
      When we look at other worlds in the Milky Way and wonder if they have life, it's not
   Segment 46
      0:03:05.960000 ---> 0:03:08.760000
      just enough to check to see if they're in the habitable zone.
   Segment 47
      0:03:08.760000 ---> 0:03:11.920000
      We need to know what shape their atmosphere is in.
   Segment 48
      0:03:11.920000 ---> 0:03:16.880000
      Astronomers have actually discovered planets located in the habitable zones around other
   Segment 49
      0:03:16.880000 ---> 0:03:17.880000
      stars.
   Segment 50
      0:03:17.880000 ---> 0:03:21.880000
      From what we can tell, they're probably not places you want to live.
   Segment 51
      0:03:21.880000 ---> 0:03:24.400000
      They're orbiting red dwarf stars.
   Segment 52
      0:03:24.400000 ---> 0:03:26.160000
      Well, it doesn't sound too bad.
   Segment 53
      0:03:26.160000 ---> 0:03:31.760000
      We live in a red tinted landscape, provided it came with an Angelo Badelamenti soundtrack.
   Segment 54
      0:03:31.760000 ---> 0:03:34.360000
      Red dwarf stars are extremely violent in their youth.
   Segment 55
      0:03:34.360000 ---> 0:03:39.600000
      They blast out enormous solar flares and coronal mass ejections.
   Segment 56
      0:03:39.600000 ---> 0:03:43.920000
      These would scour the surface of any planet caught orbiting them close enough for liquid
   Segment 57
      0:03:43.920000 ---> 0:03:45.760000
      water to be present.
   Segment 58
      0:03:45.760000 ---> 0:03:47.160000
      There is some hope.
   Segment 59
      0:03:47.160000 ---> 0:03:52.920000
      After a few hundred million years of high activity, these red dwarf stars settle down and sip
   Segment 60
      0:03:52.920000 ---> 0:03:58.080000
      away at their fuel reserves of hydrogen for potentially trillions of years.
   Segment 61
      0:03:58.080000 ---> 0:04:03.920000
      If life can hold on long enough to get through the early stages, it might have a long existence
   Segment 62
      0:04:03.920000 ---> 0:04:04.920000
      ahead of it.
   Segment 63
      0:04:05.280000 ---> 0:04:09.200000
      So when we think about a new home among the stars, we're trying to seek out new life
   Segment 64
      0:04:09.200000 ---> 0:04:12.960000
      in the universe, but for planets in the habitable zone.
   Segment 65
      0:04:12.960000 ---> 0:04:15.520000
      As we've seen, it's only a rough guideline.
   Segment 66
      0:04:15.520000 ---> 0:04:20.440000
      You probably want to check out the place first and make sure it's truly livable before you
   Segment 67
      0:04:20.440000 ---> 0:04:23.440000
      commit to a timeshare condo around Gliza 581.
   Segment 68
      0:04:23.440000 ---> 0:04:27.440000
      Do you think habitable planets are common in the Milky Way?
   Segment 69
      0:04:27.440000 ---> 0:04:31.320000
      Tell us what your perfect planet environment might be in the comments below.

Transcription for What Makes A Planet Habitable# – New Mini Documentary.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:06
      What makes a planet habitable?
   Segment 2
      0:00:06 ---> 0:00:14
      There are many planets in the entire universe, but as far as we know, there is only a handful which could possibly support life.
   Segment 3
      0:00:14 ---> 0:00:24
      Space scientists and astronomers continuously scour the vastness of space to find signs of life elsewhere in the solar system, and even outside of it.
   Segment 4
      0:00:24 ---> 0:00:35
      Now, taking one celestial body at a time, devoting all your time and resources to ascertain whether it supports life, would be too imprudent and wasteful.
   Segment 5
      0:00:35 ---> 0:00:43
      That's why astronomers look for certain pointers in a celestial body, and then determine if it has the potential to support life.
   Segment 6
      0:00:43 ---> 0:00:46
      In other words, whether it's habitable.
   Segment 7
      0:00:46 ---> 0:00:50
      So, what are the requirements for a planet to support life?
   Segment 8
      0:00:50 ---> 0:00:52
      Are there more habitable planets?
   Segment 9
      0:00:52 ---> 0:01:00
      These are some of the questions which we will explore today on Forbidden Knowledge.
   Segment 10
      0:01:00 ---> 0:01:10
      In the recent years, there has been a great deal of talking about finding liquid water on Mars and the possibility of life existing on the Red Planet.
   Segment 11
      0:01:10 ---> 0:01:19
      All this coverage has resulted in a lot of questions being raised for people always staring out into space, including a few interesting ones.
   Segment 12
      0:01:19 ---> 0:01:27
      For example, is the existence of water the only condition that needs to be present on a planet in order to host life?
   Segment 13
      0:01:27 ---> 0:01:36
      To better answer that question, let's look at the various factors that make a planet habitable, taking cues from Earth.
   Segment 14
      0:01:36 ---> 0:01:43
      As of now, we do not have any concrete proof of the existence of life anywhere else in the universe.
   Segment 15
      0:01:43 ---> 0:01:57
      Therefore, in order to establish the criteria of habitability of a planet, or a natural satellite, the conditions that support life on Earth also need to be extrapolated for other celestial objects.
   Segment 16
      0:01:57 ---> 0:02:09
      In other words, since we haven't found proof of life anywhere else, the basic conditions that support life on Earth can be taken as a benchmark for the sustenance of life on any planet.
   Segment 17
      0:02:09 ---> 0:02:15
      There are a number of conditions that a celestial body must fulfill in order to support life.
   Segment 18
      0:02:15 ---> 0:02:22
      These conditions involve certain geochemical, astrophysical, astrological and geophysical criteria.
   Segment 19
      0:02:22 ---> 0:02:37
      According to NASA, for a celestial body to sustain life, there should be extended regions of liquid water, conditions favorable for the assembly of complex organic molecules and energy sources to sustain metabolism.
   Segment 20
      0:02:37 ---> 0:02:51
      When gauging the habitability of a planet, a number of factors must be considered, including the planet's bulk composition, orbital properties, atmosphere and potential chemical interactions.
   Segment 21
      0:02:51 ---> 0:02:55
      Some of the requisite conditions are as follows.
   Segment 22
      0:02:55 ---> 0:02:58
      Astronomical properties.
   Segment 23
      0:02:59 ---> 0:03:07
      For a planet to sustain life, it has to be a comfortable distance away from a star, such as the son of our solar system.
   Segment 24
      0:03:07 ---> 0:03:16
      Around a star, there's a shell-shaped region of space called the habitable zone, where a planet can maintain liquid water on the surface.
   Segment 25
      0:03:16 ---> 0:03:23
      If a planet lies in this region, then there are good chances for the habitability of life on the surface.
   Segment 26
      0:03:23 ---> 0:03:32
      However, if life could exist without water in a certain part of the universe, then the definition of a habitable zone will change drastically.
   Segment 27
      0:03:32 ---> 0:03:41
      Also, since a star becomes more luminous as it ages, a planet must be farther away from it in the habitable zone to sustain life.
   Segment 28
      0:03:41 ---> 0:03:44
      Stability of stars.
   Segment 29
      0:03:44 ---> 0:03:50
      For a planet, it's important that the stars closest to it are stable in terms of their luminosity.
   Segment 30
      0:03:50 ---> 0:04:00
      Although every star's luminosity increases with time, it should not be too severe, or else it could simply burn up everything on the closest planet.
   Segment 31
      0:04:00 ---> 0:04:08
      Since Earth is a terrestrial planet and is habitable, it is assumed that a planet must be made up of rocks, not gases.
   Segment 32
      0:04:08 ---> 0:04:15
      Therefore, we don't expect to find life on gas giants like Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   Segment 33
      0:04:15 ---> 0:04:24
      However, there could be life on the cloud tops of these planets, but it's highly unlikely as there is no surface, and the gravity of these planets is very high.
   Segment 34
      0:04:24 ---> 0:04:26
      Mass matters.
   Segment 35
      0:04:26 ---> 0:04:32
      A planet with low mass is not suitable for habitation because low mass means low gravity.
   Segment 36
      0:04:32 ---> 0:04:43
      Low gravity further means that the planet won't be able to retain an atmosphere, as constituent gases will easily reach escape velocity and be lost in open space.
   Segment 37
      0:04:43 ---> 0:04:47
      However, there are some exceptions to this condition.
   Segment 38
      0:04:47 ---> 0:04:57
      One of Jupiter's moons, Io, is a small celestial body, yet it is volcanically dynamic and has distant chances of harboring life.
   Segment 39
      0:04:57 ---> 0:05:00
      Rotation and Revolution.
   Segment 40
      0:05:00 ---> 0:05:08
      A planet must also rotate on its axis and revolve around its parent star, like Earth going around the Sun, to be habitable.
   Segment 41
      0:05:08 ---> 0:05:17
      Furthermore, if life on the planet is to be given a chance to evolve, certain other conditions have to be met in its rotational motion.
   Segment 42
      0:05:17 ---> 0:05:27
      For example, there should be some axial tilt perpendicular to its orbit, which will result in seasons on the planet or celestial objects.
   Segment 43
      0:05:27 ---> 0:05:29
      A molten core.
   Segment 44
      0:05:29 ---> 0:05:38
      To sustain any type of life, a planet requires a rapidly rotating magnetic field to protect it from flares from nearby stars.
   Segment 45
      0:05:38 ---> 0:05:42
      This is what we call the core of the planet.
   Segment 46
      0:05:42 ---> 0:05:55
      A planetary core is a terrific source of geothermal energy, allows cycling of raw materials, and spawns a magnetic field around the planet to protect it from harmful radiation.
   Segment 47
      0:05:55 ---> 0:06:05
      It should be noted that Mars was known to have a liquid core at one time, but its heat dissipated quickly because Mars is a smaller planet.
   Segment 48
      0:06:05 ---> 0:06:07
      Holding in atmosphere.
   Segment 49
      0:06:07 ---> 0:06:18
      Earth's atmosphere not only fulfills most of our basic needs of providing oxygen, but also keeps the planet warm by trapping carbon dioxide and other gases.
   Segment 50
      0:06:18 ---> 0:06:25
      It also protects life on the planet by blocking the vast majority of harmful radiation.
   Segment 51
      0:06:25 ---> 0:06:35
      Therefore, any habitable planet must have all the necessary conditions in place to have an atmosphere, or at least a protective layer of essential gases.
   Segment 52
      0:06:35 ---> 0:06:45
      As stated earlier, since we do not know the existence of any life outside of Earth, these assumptions are deduced from the particular conditions that support life on Earth.
   Segment 53
      0:06:45 ---> 0:06:54
      If however, there are organisms who can survive in altogether different conditions than what we have experienced here on Earth, then who really knows?
   Segment 54
      0:06:54 ---> 0:06:57
      Maybe we already have company.
   Segment 55
      0:06:57 ---> 0:07:00
      Are there more habitable planets?
   Segment 56
      0:07:00 ---> 0:07:05
      Our satellites have been picking up on Earth-like habitable planets for some time though.
   Segment 57
      0:07:05 ---> 0:07:13
      We found many planets which seem to fit the bill partially, but then being far away has stopped us from getting any proper evidence.
   Segment 58
      0:07:13 ---> 0:07:23
      Scientists have discovered planets which have been deemed livable, or we think that they are livable, because they lie in the habitable zone of their respective stars.
   Segment 59
      0:07:23 ---> 0:07:28
      This means that they could have liquid water and thus sustained life.
   Segment 60
      0:07:28 ---> 0:07:34
      They also fulfill some factors that have been mentioned some of these planets include...
   Segment 61
      0:07:34 ---> 0:07:36
      Proxima B.
   Segment 62
      0:07:36 ---> 0:07:43
      This planet revolves around the star Proxima Centauri. The star is 4.2 light years away from the Sun.
   Segment 63
      0:07:43 ---> 0:07:47
      It weighs around 1.3 times more than Earth.
   Segment 64
      0:07:47 ---> 0:07:52
      It could have liquid water, but that depends on its atmospheric conditions.
   Segment 65
      0:07:52 ---> 0:07:58
      But as nothing is known about its atmosphere, we cannot be sure about it having water.
   Segment 66
      0:07:58 ---> 0:08:00
      Wolf 1061-C.
   Segment 67
      0:08:00 ---> 0:08:07
      It's located in the constellation Ophiuchus and revolves around the Red Dwarf Wolf 1061.
   Segment 68
      0:08:07 ---> 0:08:12
      The planet is approximately 13.8 light years from Earth.
   Segment 69
      0:08:12 ---> 0:08:15
      It's around 4.3 times larger than Earth.
   Segment 70
      0:08:15 ---> 0:08:20
      It has a short revolution time of about 17.9 days.
   Segment 71
      0:08:20 ---> 0:08:23
      Gleta 832-C.
   Segment 72
      0:08:23 ---> 0:08:29
      It revolves around the Red Dwarf Gleta 832 and is present in its habitable zone.
   Segment 73
      0:08:29 ---> 0:08:36
      Its size is around 5 times that of Earth. Because of this, it's often called a super Earth.
   Segment 74
      0:08:36 ---> 0:08:40
      The planet is 16 light years away from our planet.
   Segment 75
      0:08:40 ---> 0:08:43
      Trappist 1D.
   Segment 76
      0:08:43 ---> 0:08:49
      This planet is around 40 light years away from us and is in the constellation of Aquarius.
   Segment 77
      0:08:49 ---> 0:08:55
      It revolves around an ultra cool Red Dwarf known as Trappist 1.
   Segment 78
      0:08:56 ---> 0:09:00

Transcription for Why extremophiles bode well for life beyond Earth - Louisa Preston.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:11.120000
      We've all seen movies about terrible insects from outer space, or stories of abduction
   Segment 2
      0:00:11.120000 ---> 0:00:12.840000
      by little green men.
   Segment 3
      0:00:12.840000 ---> 0:00:17.440000
      But the study of life in the universe, including the possibility of extraterrestrial life,
   Segment 4
      0:00:17.440000 ---> 0:00:21.120000
      is also a serious scientific pursuit.
   Segment 5
      0:00:21.120000 ---> 0:00:27.520000
      Astrobiology draws on diverse fields, such as physics, biology, astronomy and geology,
   Segment 6
      0:00:27.520000 ---> 0:00:33.960000
      to study how life was formed on Earth, how it could form elsewhere, and how we might detect it.
   Segment 7
      0:00:33.960000 ---> 0:00:38.760000
      Many ancient religions described other worlds inhabited by non-human beings, but these were
   Segment 8
      0:00:38.760000 ---> 0:00:45.120000
      more like mythical realms or parallel universes than other planets existing in the same physical world.
   Segment 9
      0:00:45.120000 ---> 0:00:49
      It is only within the last century that scientists have been able to seriously undertake the
   Segment 10
      0:00:49 ---> 0:00:52
      search for extraterrestrial life.
   Segment 11
      0:00:52 ---> 0:00:55.920000
      We know that at the most basic level, organisms on Earth need three things.
   Segment 12
      0:00:55.920000 ---> 0:01:00.560000
      Liquid water, a source of energy, and organic carbon-based material.
   Segment 13
      0:01:00.560000 ---> 0:01:04.400000
      We also know that the Earth is just the right distance from the Sun, so as not to be either
   Segment 14
      0:01:04.400000 ---> 0:01:06.720000
      frozen or molten.
   Segment 15
      0:01:06.720000 ---> 0:01:13.520000
      So planets within such a habitable range from their own stars may be able to support life.
   Segment 16
      0:01:13.520000 ---> 0:01:17.840000
      But while we used to think that life could only exist in such Earth-like environments,
   Segment 17
      0:01:17.840000 ---> 0:01:23.080000
      one of the most amazing discoveries of Astrobiology has been just how versatile life is.
   Segment 18
      0:01:23.080000 ---> 0:01:27.080000
      We now know that life can thrive in some of the most extreme environments that be fatal
   Segment 19
      0:01:27.080000 ---> 0:01:29.560000
      for most known organisms.
   Segment 20
      0:01:29.560000 ---> 0:01:33.680000
      Life is found everywhere from black smoker hydrothermal vents in the dark depths of
   Segment 21
      0:01:33.680000 ---> 0:01:39.400000
      Earth's oceans, to bubbling hot acidic springs on the flanks of volcanoes, to high up in
   Segment 22
      0:01:39.400000 ---> 0:01:41.560000
      the atmosphere.
   Segment 23
      0:01:41.560000 ---> 0:01:45.760000
      Organisms that live in these challenging environments are called extremophiles, and
   Segment 24
      0:01:45.760000 ---> 0:01:51.120000
      they can survive at extremes of temperature, pressure and radiation, as well as salinity,
   Segment 25
      0:01:52.120000 ---> 0:01:57.320000
      and limited availability of sunlight, water or oxygen.
   Segment 26
      0:01:57.320000 ---> 0:02:01.600000
      What is most remarkable about these extremophiles is that they are found thriving in environments
   Segment 27
      0:02:01.600000 ---> 0:02:04.360000
      that mimic those on alien worlds.
   Segment 28
      0:02:04.360000 ---> 0:02:09.080000
      One of the most important to these worlds is our Red and Dusty neighbour, Mars.
   Segment 29
      0:02:09.080000 ---> 0:02:14.520000
      Today, Astrobiologists are exploring places where life might once have existed on Mars,
   Segment 30
      0:02:14.520000 ---> 0:02:17.160000
      using NASA's Curiosity rover.
   Segment 31
      0:02:17.160000 ---> 0:02:22.040000
      One of these is Gale Crater, an impact crater created when a meteor hit the surface of Mars
   Segment 32
      0:02:22.040000 ---> 0:02:25.240000
      nearly 3.8 billion years ago.
   Segment 33
      0:02:25.240000 ---> 0:02:29.560000
      Evidence from orbit suggests past traces of water, which means a crater might once have
   Segment 34
      0:02:29.560000 ---> 0:02:32
      supported life.
   Segment 35
      0:02:32 ---> 0:02:36.600000
      Planets are not the only places Astrobiologists are looking at, for example Europa, one of
   Segment 36
      0:02:36.600000 ---> 0:02:43.320000
      the moons of Jupiter, and Enceladus and Titan, two of Saturn's moons, are all exciting possibilities.
   Segment 37
      0:02:43.320000 ---> 0:02:47.440000
      Although these moons are extremely cold, and two are covered in thick ice, there is
   Segment 38
      0:02:47.440000 ---> 0:02:50.640000
      evidence of liquid oceans beneath this shell.
   Segment 39
      0:02:50.640000 ---> 0:02:53.400000
      Could life be floating around in these oceans?
   Segment 40
      0:02:53.400000 ---> 0:02:58.080000
      Or could it be living around black smoke events at their bottom?
   Segment 41
      0:02:58.080000 ---> 0:03:02.400000
      Titan is particularly promising, as it has an atmosphere and earth-like lakes, seas and
   Segment 42
      0:03:02.400000 ---> 0:03:04.880000
      rivers flowing across its surface.
   Segment 43
      0:03:04.880000 ---> 0:03:09.560000
      It is very cold, however, too cold for liquid water, so these rivers may instead be flowing
   Segment 44
      0:03:09.640000 ---> 0:03:13.640000
      with liquid hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane.
   Segment 45
      0:03:13.640000 ---> 0:03:18.560000
      These are composed of hydrogen, and more importantly, carbon, which is the basic building block
   Segment 46
      0:03:18.560000 ---> 0:03:21.080000
      of all life as we know it.
   Segment 47
      0:03:21.080000 ---> 0:03:23.680000
      So could life be found in these lakes?
   Segment 48
      0:03:23.680000 ---> 0:03:27.520000
      Although instruments are being designed to study these distant worlds, it takes many years
   Segment 49
      0:03:27.520000 ---> 0:03:31.320000
      to build them, and even longer to get them where they need to be.
   Segment 50
      0:03:31.320000 ---> 0:03:36.440000
      In the meantime, Astrobiologists work in our own natural laboratory, the earth, to learn
   Segment 51
      0:03:36.440000 ---> 0:03:40.400000
      about all the weird and wonderful forms of life that can exist, and to help us one
   Segment 52
      0:03:40.400000 ---> 0:03:43.480000
      day answer one of humanity's oldest questions.
   Segment 53
      0:03:43.480000 ---> 0:03:44.480000
      Are we alone?
