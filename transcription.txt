   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:07
      In this video, we're going to talk about 19th century morning attire practices in the United States.
   Segment 2
      0:00:07 ---> 0:00:17
      The practice of wearing morning attire was adopted as a means of demonstrating the all-consuming depths of one's sorrow,
   Segment 3
      0:00:17 ---> 0:00:23
      and is thought to have evolved from the modest and drab clothing worn by nuns and monks.
   Segment 4
      0:00:23 ---> 0:00:30
      Although predating the 19th century, it was during the romantic era that the practice truly reached its height,
   Segment 5
      0:00:30 ---> 0:00:34
      becoming widespread throughout Western society.
   Segment 6
      0:00:34 ---> 0:00:45
      Some, in fact, point to the English Queen Victoria's morning habits as the catalyst that intensified this trend in the second half of the 19th century.
   Segment 7
      0:00:45 ---> 0:00:52
      When her husband died in 1861, she adopted the practice of wearing morning attire for the rest of her life,
   Segment 8
      0:00:52 ---> 0:00:58
      and her status as a widow became a fundamental part of her identity.
   Segment 9
      0:00:58 ---> 0:01:05
      Other reasons for the growth of this practice included high mortality rates, particularly in the United States,
   Segment 10
      0:01:05 ---> 0:01:14
      which was embroiled in civil war, the growth of the middle class, and technological advancements within the textile industry
   Segment 11
      0:01:14 ---> 0:01:19
      that made morning fabrics more widely available to the masses.
   Segment 12
      0:01:19 ---> 0:01:27
      Now, we're going to dig into some facty details, but one of the main ideas I really want to get across in this video
   Segment 13
      0:01:27 ---> 0:01:34
      is that morning in the 19th century, in the United States, was, on the one hand, an expression of real personal grief,
   Segment 14
      0:01:34 ---> 0:01:41
      but was, on the other hand, a compulsory and sometimes burdensome social ritual.
   Segment 15
      0:01:41 ---> 0:01:49
      When I say that the practices of mourning were compulsory, I don't mean to suggest that they were legally mandated,
   Segment 16
      0:01:49 ---> 0:01:57
      rather, these were deep-seeded social norms that one followed or broke at the risk of one's social peril.
   Segment 17
      0:01:57 ---> 0:02:07
      In the Victorian age, the process of public grieving and making a distinction here between private mourning and the public performance of grieving
   Segment 18
      0:02:07 ---> 0:02:18
      was not relegated to the funeral alone, but rather became an all-encompassing facet of life in the months and sometimes years following a family death.
   Segment 19
      0:02:18 ---> 0:02:26
      Widows, meaning wives who lost their husbands, were expected to wear mourning clothing for up to four years.
   Segment 20
      0:02:26 ---> 0:02:32
      The first year of this time was known as the period of deep or full mourning.
   Segment 21
      0:02:32 ---> 0:02:41
      Widows were expected to wear matte black clothing, preferably crepe, a fabric that was crinkled gauzy with a matte finish.
   Segment 22
      0:02:41 ---> 0:02:45
      It was meant to look nice, but also humble.
   Segment 23
      0:02:45 ---> 0:02:55
      Importantly, it signaled to viewers immediately that the wearer was in mourning, as this fabric was only used in the context of mourning.
   Segment 24
      0:02:55 ---> 0:03:02
      For their part, widowers, men who lost their wives, were expected to wear black and white linen.
   Segment 25
      0:03:02 ---> 0:03:11
      Although black attire may have been its most visible aspect, as a social obligation mourning was not limited to clothing alone,
   Segment 26
      0:03:11 ---> 0:03:21
      during deep mourning men and women were also expected to withdraw from society as much as possible and remain sequestered within their homes.
   Segment 27
      0:03:21 ---> 0:03:31
      Edicate books offered lengthy advice on social conundrums related to mourning, what to do if a friend marries while you're in mourning, etc.
   Segment 28
      0:03:31 ---> 0:03:42
      However, this requirement was softer for men, as society viewed men's labor and presence more necessary for the regular continuance of daily life.
   Segment 29
      0:03:42 ---> 0:03:44
      We'll come back to this.
   Segment 30
      0:03:44 ---> 0:03:48
      The second main stage of mourning was half mourning.
   Segment 31
      0:03:48 ---> 0:03:58
      During half mourning, women were permitted to wear shinier fabrics, decorative trims, including beads, feathers, flowers, etc., and jewelry.
   Segment 32
      0:03:58 ---> 0:04:08
      During this period, women were also permitted to begin re-entering a more normal social life, and just generally easing back into society.
   Segment 33
      0:04:08 ---> 0:04:18
      Although the original idea behind mourning attire may have been the erasure of personal identity, a way of signaling one's total submission in the face of grief,
   Segment 34
      0:04:18 ---> 0:04:24
      half mourning attire in particular was increasingly viewed as quite fashionable.
   Segment 35
      0:04:24 ---> 0:04:31
      Black clothing was severe and serious, but also seen as quite chic.
   Segment 36
      0:04:31 ---> 0:04:44
      Thanks to Queen Victoria's trend setting, it wasn't exclusively worn during mourning anymore, and dark browns could sometimes be quite difficult to distinguish depending on the light.
   Segment 37
      0:04:44 ---> 0:04:52
      Because black dyes were historically very expensive, black fabric has also been long associated with wealth.
   Segment 38
      0:04:52 ---> 0:05:00
      Here, by the way, are a couple examples of mourning accessories meant to accentuate your mourning wardrobe.
   Segment 39
      0:05:00 ---> 0:05:12
      By the later part of the century, department stores began marketing attractive mourning wear to middle-class clientele, suggesting the many ways that they might show their grief, but make it fashion.
   Segment 40
      0:05:12 ---> 0:05:23
      This easy availability was enabled by changes in textile production technology that transformed the consumerist landscape when it came to clothing,
   Segment 41
      0:05:23 ---> 0:05:33
      launching a movement known as Ready to Wear Outfits that could be purchased as is off the rack rather than specifically made for the customer.
   Segment 42
      0:05:33 ---> 0:05:40
      Mornings, as you may be getting to notice, was a practice that involved conspicuous consumption.
   Segment 43
      0:05:40 ---> 0:05:46
      Despite the wider availability of these clothes, it was expensive to mourn.
   Segment 44
      0:05:46 ---> 0:05:55
      Clothing manufacturers put out fake crepe that could be sold more cheaply, but even this was mostly sold to the middle-class.
   Segment 45
      0:05:55 ---> 0:06:02
      For the middle-class, mourning attire was actually seen as sort of liberating to an extent.
   Segment 46
      0:06:02 ---> 0:06:09
      It helped to limit the visible distance between upper and lower-class attire, effectively evening the field.
   Segment 47
      0:06:09 ---> 0:06:22
      Though intended to suggest modesty, that the wearer was free from trivial social concerns, mourning wear ironically became a public display of moderate wealth and middle-class identity.
   Segment 48
      0:06:22 ---> 0:06:28
      However, for the poor, this was a truly financially oppressive prospect.
   Segment 49
      0:06:28 ---> 0:06:36
      Those who couldn't afford new attire often purchased black dye instead and used it to color their existing clothing.
   Segment 50
      0:06:37 ---> 0:06:49
      This makeshift solution, however, was looked down upon by the middle and upper class, who wrote mockingly about being able to spot other colors peeking through fading black dye.
   Segment 51
      0:06:49 ---> 0:06:58
      This practice was also oppressive for many women across the board, on whose laps the greatest burden of these practices felt.
   Segment 52
      0:06:58 ---> 0:07:06
      Deep mourning could be socially isolating, adding an emotional strain on an already taxing time.
   Segment 53
      0:07:06 ---> 0:07:11
      Some women expressed frustration with the rigidity of these rituals.
   Segment 54
      0:07:11 ---> 0:07:21
      If a relative died, even one with whom they had little familiarity, society nonetheless mandated that they go into at least a short period of mourning.
   Segment 55
      0:07:21 ---> 0:07:27
      Take, for example, this salty-sounding letter from a woman whose sister-in-law had just died.
   Segment 56
      0:07:27 ---> 0:07:28
      Quote,
   Segment 57
      0:07:28 ---> 0:07:31
      We have just heard of the death of Lady Gibson.
   Segment 58
      0:07:31 ---> 0:07:38
      I thought she would die soon when I got a colored poplin from Ireland the other day.
   Segment 59
      0:07:38 ---> 0:07:45
      Moreover, fear of not getting the rules quite right also caused a lot of anxiety for women.
   Segment 60
      0:07:45 ---> 0:07:57
      Although mourning attire was considered attractive, fashionable even, women also faced severe judgment if you are perceived as being too fashionable, too overdone.
   Segment 61
      0:07:57 ---> 0:08:06
      In letters and diaries from the era, women expressed anxiety that their half-morning fashions may make them seem insincere in their grief.
   Segment 62
      0:08:06 ---> 0:08:16
      In a widow and her friends, artist Charles Dana Gibson pokes fun at the performative social rituals involved in the mourning process.
   Segment 63
      0:08:16 ---> 0:08:30
      His drawings betray an awareness that grief in Victorian society was not solely private, but was a public display wherein one may fall victim to any number of serious social faux pas.
   Segment 64
      0:08:30 ---> 0:08:38
      While these complaints may sound trivial, remember that these anxieties would have been cumulative for women.
   Segment 65
      0:08:38 ---> 0:08:51
      Compounding into a sense that every aspect of their lives, even moments of vulnerability as in the death of a loved one, were somehow available for public consumption and dissection.
   Segment 66
      0:08:51 ---> 0:08:54
      So why don't we do this today?
   Segment 67
      0:08:54 ---> 0:08:59
      By the early 1900s, mourning attire began to seem outdated.
   Segment 68
      0:08:59 ---> 0:09:08
      New women, feminists, had been pushing against rigid gender norms in society and many of their debates centered around clothing.
   Segment 69
      0:09:08 ---> 0:09:18
      In addition to donning bloomers and railing against the dangers of corsets, feminists of the era also set their sights on mourningwear and practices.
   Segment 70
      0:09:18 ---> 0:09:23
      By now, hopefully, it shouldn't be too hard to see why.
   Segment 71
      0:09:23 ---> 0:09:30
      However, the final death now, if you will allow me this morbid pun, was the First World War.
   Segment 72
      0:09:30 ---> 0:09:41
      For one thing, fast numbers of working-age men heading to the war front meant that women increasingly stepped into labor roles hitherto kept from them.
   Segment 73
      0:09:41 ---> 0:09:51
      It simply would not be practical for women to enter into months or years of mourning that would limit their ability to fully contribute to wartime society.
   Segment 74
      0:09:51 ---> 0:10:04
      Moreover, others worried that the widespread wearing of mourning attire would negatively impact wartime morale, making the reality of battlefield death ever present and visible in society.
   Segment 75
      0:10:04 ---> 0:10:15
      Ultimately, Western society came to the slow realization that such rigid rituals of mourning were no longer compatible with modern life.
   Segment 76
      0:10:15 ---> 0:10:21
      In conclusion, mourning practices heavily intensified in the 19th century.
   Segment 77
      0:10:21 ---> 0:10:28
      This growth coincided with the rise of romanticism, which spurred on a more sentimental relationship toward death.
   Segment 78
      0:10:28 ---> 0:10:44
      The period of mourning, which itself had multiple phases, involved both the wearing of prescribed attire, as well as the fulfillment of special social obligations, namely for women a full withdrawal from society.
   Segment 79
      0:10:44 ---> 0:10:58
      Such practices were oppressive for the poor, for whom the all-black attire engendered an economic burden, and also for women who were especially impacted by the mourning period's restrictions.
   Segment 80
      0:10:58 ---> 0:11:08
      Eventually, these mourning rituals fell out of favor, thanks both to the rise of the feminist movement, as well as the practical requirements of the First World War.

Transcription for audio2.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:06.240000
      In this video, we are going to discuss Henry P. Robinson's Fading Away.
   Segment 2
      0:00:06.240000 ---> 0:00:11.320000
      Just to give you a quick content warning, the gender politics at play in this discussion
   Segment 3
      0:00:11.320000 ---> 0:00:13.480000
      are uncomfortable.
   Segment 4
      0:00:13.480000 ---> 0:00:18.760000
      And though there is nothing explicit here, it may nonetheless be triggering for sexual
   Segment 5
      0:00:18.760000 ---> 0:00:23.040000
      violence and eating disorders.
   Segment 6
      0:00:23.040000 ---> 0:00:29.920000
      Henry P. Robinson's Fading Away is a combination print, purporting to show a young woman, slowly
   Segment 7
      0:00:29.920000 ---> 0:00:33.400000
      dying of tuberculosis.
   Segment 8
      0:00:33.400000 ---> 0:00:39.480000
      Although appearing as a single unified scene, a combination print is a collage of multiple
   Segment 9
      0:00:39.480000 ---> 0:00:45.160000
      posed photographs that have been stitched together in the darkroom.
   Segment 10
      0:00:45.160000 ---> 0:00:49.080000
      Each figure was posed independently and photographed.
   Segment 11
      0:00:49.080000 ---> 0:00:54
      Robinson then cut out each figure from their negative and arranged them together into a
   Segment 12
      0:00:54 ---> 0:00:55.960000
      single scene.
   Segment 13
      0:00:55.960000 ---> 0:01:00.880000
      Whereas we tend to think about photographs as wrote representation of reality, it's
   Segment 14
      0:01:00.880000 ---> 0:01:06.920000
      important to note that this is an artistically arranged scene, meant to be understood as fine
   Segment 15
      0:01:06.920000 ---> 0:01:11.080000
      art rather than straightforward documentation.
   Segment 16
      0:01:11.080000 ---> 0:01:16.360000
      Henry P. Robinson, a British photographer, was one of the first to take up photography
   Segment 17
      0:01:16.360000 ---> 0:01:22.720000
      for its artistic rather than practical functions, and was working against critics of photography
   Segment 18
      0:01:22.720000 ---> 0:01:30.080000
      who argued that the technology could record but could not interpret or beautify.
   Segment 19
      0:01:30.080000 ---> 0:01:36.040000
      Here Robinson demonstrates the photograph's emotional and aesthetic potential.
   Segment 20
      0:01:36.040000 ---> 0:01:41.640000
      As a side note, he was successful in this pursuit, as his patrons included the likes
   Segment 21
      0:01:41.640000 ---> 0:01:47.760000
      of Queen Victoria, who put in a standing order for a copy of every major combination print
   Segment 22
      0:01:47.760000 ---> 0:01:50.040000
      he produced.
   Segment 23
      0:01:50.040000 ---> 0:01:55.440000
      The big takeaway here is that Robinson's choices in this work are purposeful rather
   Segment 24
      0:01:55.440000 ---> 0:02:01.160000
      than coincidental and should be interpreted in the same way as one might interrogate an
   Segment 25
      0:02:01.160000 ---> 0:02:04.960000
      image in any other artistic medium.
   Segment 26
      0:02:04.960000 ---> 0:02:11.600000
      The scene presents a romantic family tragedy, a situation that would have been immediately
   Segment 27
      0:02:11.600000 ---> 0:02:14.360000
      readable to viewers of the time.
   Segment 28
      0:02:14.360000 ---> 0:02:19.560000
      At first glance, one might assume that this image depicts the 19th century ideal of the
   Segment 29
      0:02:19.560000 ---> 0:02:24.080000
      good death, a death attended by family and friends.
   Segment 30
      0:02:24.080000 ---> 0:02:30.760000
      Her mother or grandmother sits vigil at her feet and a cousin or sister at her head.
   Segment 31
      0:02:30.760000 ---> 0:02:36.680000
      In the background we see perhaps her father, peering out the window contemplating the impending
   Segment 32
      0:02:36.680000 ---> 0:02:37.680000
      loss.
   Segment 33
      0:02:37.680000 ---> 0:02:44.480000
      However, things become a bit murkier when we began to look at the criticism for this specific
   Segment 34
      0:02:44.480000 ---> 0:02:49.520000
      work and the wider cultural context of the time.
   Segment 35
      0:02:49.520000 ---> 0:02:55.240000
      Whereas, due to the ages, modern viewers are likely to read this as a straightforward
   Segment 36
      0:02:55.240000 ---> 0:03:02.560000
      family scene, critics from the time understood the photograph in terms that were less chased.
   Segment 37
      0:03:02.560000 ---> 0:03:08.480000
      Rather than a father, the silhouetted figure in the back was instead seen as a husband,
   Segment 38
      0:03:08.480000 ---> 0:03:11.960000
      or perhaps even an unwed lover.
   Segment 39
      0:03:11.960000 ---> 0:03:15.360000
      He stares at the window at the gathering clouds.
   Segment 40
      0:03:15.360000 ---> 0:03:18.280000
      His hand covers his face in guilt.
   Segment 41
      0:03:18.280000 ---> 0:03:26.120000
      His inability to protect his love, or perhaps regret over selling her virginal innocence
   Segment 42
      0:03:26.120000 ---> 0:03:29.480000
      as it would have been seen at the time.
   Segment 43
      0:03:29.480000 ---> 0:03:34.480000
      Due to his central positioning and looming presence within the composition, this story
   Segment 44
      0:03:34.480000 ---> 0:03:41.120000
      seems to be as much about his psychic state as it is about the young woman in the foreground.
   Segment 45
      0:03:41.120000 ---> 0:03:47.600000
      In this way, the photograph relates more so to the beautiful rather than the good death.
   Segment 46
      0:03:47.600000 ---> 0:03:54.560000
      In contrast to the good death, the beautiful death is characterized by an erotic ache.
   Segment 47
      0:03:54.560000 ---> 0:04:00.320000
      It is a scene of death possessing a yearning that goes well beyond chased moral contemplation
   Segment 48
      0:04:00.320000 ---> 0:04:02.720000
      of life's meanings.
   Segment 49
      0:04:02.720000 ---> 0:04:09.800000
      So just one more content warning here that the next slide reproduces troubling imagery.
   Segment 50
      0:04:09.800000 ---> 0:04:14.320000
      Indeed it was uncomfortably but abundantly common.
   Segment 51
      0:04:14.320000 ---> 0:04:19.880000
      In the 19th century and early 20th century art, to see conventionally beautiful young
   Segment 52
      0:04:19.880000 ---> 0:04:26.280000
      women dead or dying, usually with an older man in the scene contemplating her ill-fated
   Segment 53
      0:04:26.280000 ---> 0:04:28.360000
      loveliness.
   Segment 54
      0:04:28.360000 ---> 0:04:34.400000
      Although this trope was on the one hand meant to invite sympathies for a life cut too short,
   Segment 55
      0:04:34.400000 ---> 0:04:38.240000
      it was also exploited for sensual reasons.
   Segment 56
      0:04:38.240000 ---> 0:04:43.800000
      After all, there were only a few reasons in 19th century visual culture wherein viewers
   Segment 57
      0:04:43.800000 ---> 0:04:45.680000
      are shown a woman in bed.
   Segment 58
      0:04:45.680000 ---> 0:04:51.120000
      In those reasons were coitus and illness or death.
   Segment 59
      0:04:51.120000 ---> 0:04:56.480000
      Sometimes as we see here, these women are shown partly nude, other times in just lesser
   Segment 60
      0:04:56.480000 ---> 0:05:01.920000
      states of dress, such as a nightgown, which was nonetheless an intimate and privately
   Segment 61
      0:05:01.920000 ---> 0:05:03.920000
      worn garment.
   Segment 62
      0:05:03.920000 ---> 0:05:10.200000
      Of all the ways to die, the Victorians regarded tuberculosis, also called consumption, to
   Segment 63
      0:05:10.200000 ---> 0:05:15.920000
      be the most romantic, to contain the most erotic potential.
   Segment 64
      0:05:15.920000 ---> 0:05:22.320000
      It was a contagious bacterium that led to chronic bloody coughing, fever, weight loss,
   Segment 65
      0:05:22.320000 ---> 0:05:25
      and for about half, death.
   Segment 66
      0:05:25 ---> 0:05:31.640000
      Although this may not sound particularly romantic to us, folks from the time waxed poetic about
   Segment 67
      0:05:31.640000 ---> 0:05:35.280000
      the diseases apparent beautifying effects.
   Segment 68
      0:05:35.280000 ---> 0:05:41.480000
      It made one's skin paler, one's cheeks and lips a bit rosier, it led to weight loss
   Segment 69
      0:05:41.480000 ---> 0:05:46.320000
      and seemed to stir an intensity behind one's eyes.
   Segment 70
      0:05:46.320000 ---> 0:05:52.240000
      Pillskin, a slight frame, these were attributes prized in western beauty standards for women
   Segment 71
      0:05:52.240000 ---> 0:05:54.160000
      of the day.
   Segment 72
      0:05:54.160000 ---> 0:05:58.960000
      Folks also remarked to slice the fact that, one, it seemed to cut down people regardless
   Segment 73
      0:05:58.960000 ---> 0:06:04.240000
      of age, and two, it left the brain unaffected.
   Segment 74
      0:06:04.240000 ---> 0:06:11.680000
      At Girl in Po, for example, declared, quote, I would wish all I'd love to perish of tuberculosis.
   Segment 75
      0:06:11.680000 ---> 0:06:19.280000
      How glorious to depart in the heyday of young life, the heartful of passion, the imagination,
   Segment 76
      0:06:19.280000 ---> 0:06:21.520000
      all fire.
   Segment 77
      0:06:21.520000 ---> 0:06:27.600000
      Now some of you might be thinking, yeah, those last images were pretty gross, but maybe
   Segment 78
      0:06:27.600000 ---> 0:06:31.560000
      art historians are reading too much into Robinson's fading away.
   Segment 79
      0:06:31.800000 ---> 0:06:37.560000
      However, the central figure in this scene was previously exhibited under the title she
   Segment 80
      0:06:37.560000 ---> 0:06:42.680000
      never told her love, a phrase borrowed from Shakespeare.
   Segment 81
      0:06:42.680000 ---> 0:06:47.720000
      Under this title it becomes clear that the figure in this version dies not merely of
   Segment 82
      0:06:47.720000 ---> 0:06:55.480000
      tuberculosis, but also of a broken heart, of repressed or unrequited desire.
   Segment 83
      0:06:55.480000 ---> 0:07:00.240000
      Her sinful sexuality literally eats her from within.
   Segment 84
      0:07:00.240000 ---> 0:07:06.560000
      An image of a dead or dying woman was also the extreme logical conclusion of the era's
   Segment 85
      0:07:06.560000 ---> 0:07:09.440000
      feminine ideal.
   Segment 86
      0:07:09.440000 ---> 0:07:13.920000
      Women were to be beautiful, domestic, pure and passive.
   Segment 87
      0:07:13.920000 ---> 0:07:20.320000
      A beautiful woman now dead was a means through which western culture could suggest the transcendental
   Segment 88
      0:07:20.320000 ---> 0:07:23.680000
      value of feminine passivity.
   Segment 89
      0:07:23.680000 ---> 0:07:30.400000
      In his book Idols of Preversity, art historian Bram Dykstra writes extensively on this subject,
   Segment 90
      0:07:30.400000 ---> 0:07:37.160000
      arguing that quote, for many a Victorian husband, his wife's physical weakness, came
   Segment 91
      0:07:37.160000 ---> 0:07:42.160000
      to be evident to the world and to God of her physical and mental purity.
   Segment 92
      0:07:42.160000 ---> 0:07:47.480000
      A healthy woman, it was thought, was likely to be an unnatural woman.
   Segment 93
      0:07:47.480000 ---> 0:07:50.680000
      Proper human angels were weak, helpless and ill.
   Segment 94
      0:07:50.680000 ---> 0:07:56.280000
      In other words, through death a woman became the truest embodiment of the Victorian cultural
   Segment 95
      0:07:56.280000 ---> 0:07:57.640000
      ideal.
   Segment 96
      0:07:57.640000 ---> 0:08:02.360000
      Her passivity ensured and her purity restored.
   Segment 97
      0:08:02.360000 ---> 0:08:08.240000
      As Janie Mogason points out, women in 19th century vampire novels, for example, become
   Segment 98
      0:08:08.240000 ---> 0:08:11.600000
      proper maidens again, only through their deaths.
   Segment 99
      0:08:11.600000 ---> 0:08:16.840000
      If the man in the back of the photograph is the young woman's lover, then as Mogensen
   Segment 100
      0:08:16.840000 ---> 0:08:23.440000
      argues, the moral here seems to be that quote, dying has restored her passivity, her
   Segment 101
      0:08:23.440000 ---> 0:08:26.480000
      innocence and her spiritual peace.
   Segment 102
      0:08:26.480000 ---> 0:08:28.920000
      Death has worked its magic.
   Segment 103
      0:08:28.920000 ---> 0:08:34.640000
      The familiar ideal that we're talking about here had several real world oppressive consequences
   Segment 104
      0:08:34.640000 ---> 0:08:36.440000
      on women.
   Segment 105
      0:08:36.440000 ---> 0:08:42.120000
      Wastes were to be smaller, women were to be frailer, weak to the point of illness.
   Segment 106
      0:08:42.120000 ---> 0:08:48.520000
      In fact, Bram Dykstra has pointed to the 19th century as the historical origins of modern
   Segment 107
      0:08:48.520000 ---> 0:08:50.800000
      eating disorders.
   Segment 108
      0:08:50.800000 ---> 0:08:57.040000
      Abigold Wollsen, an American woman in 1873, wrote about the contemporary pressures women
   Segment 109
      0:08:57.040000 ---> 0:08:58.040000
      faced.
   Segment 110
      0:08:58.040000 ---> 0:09:02.960000
      Quote, If you happen upon a group of young women at the leisure class conversing together
   Segment 111
      0:09:02.960000 ---> 0:09:08.200000
      on a bright summer afternoon, you will be sure to find them endeavoring to outshine each
   Segment 112
      0:09:08.200000 ---> 0:09:11.560000
      other in the recital of past illnesses.
   Segment 113
      0:09:11.560000 ---> 0:09:18.180000
      The familiar heroines of our books are petite and fragile, with lily fingers and taper
   Segment 114
      0:09:18.180000 ---> 0:09:23.480000
      wastes, and they are supposed to subsist on air and moonlight, and never to commit the
   Segment 115
      0:09:23.480000 ---> 0:09:28.280000
      unpardonable sin of eating in the presence of man.
   Segment 116
      0:09:28.280000 ---> 0:09:34.880000
      Longfellow, Tennyson, and the whole tuneful throng immortalize the maidens of their verse
   Segment 117
      0:09:34.880000 ---> 0:09:42.080000
      as slender and wand-like, with a step so light that the flowers scarcely nod beneath
   Segment 118
      0:09:42.080000 ---> 0:09:43.440000
      it.
   Segment 119
      0:09:43.440000 ---> 0:09:49
      Women in the 19th century went to dangerous extremes to meet these beauty standards,
   Segment 120
      0:09:49 ---> 0:09:53.840000
      wearing corset so tight for example that they restricted breathing and rearranged
   Segment 121
      0:09:53.840000 ---> 0:10:01.080000
      one's bodily organs, wearing makeup to simulate paleness that in many cases contained poisonous
   Segment 122
      0:10:01.080000 ---> 0:10:06.520000
      chemicals that in fact could quicken one's progression toward death.
   Segment 123
      0:10:06.520000 ---> 0:10:12.040000
      As an important side note, to argue that this was a choice that the women made, that no
   Segment 124
      0:10:12.040000 ---> 0:10:17.440000
      enforced them to do this, is I think missing a really important point.
   Segment 125
      0:10:17.440000 ---> 0:10:23.560000
      In her book, A Mbearable Weight, Feminist Historian and Theorist, Susan Bordeaux, discusses the
   Segment 126
      0:10:23.560000 ---> 0:10:29.600000
      way that discourse, advertisements, and other cultural pressures have led to changing and
   Segment 127
      0:10:29.600000 ---> 0:10:33.600000
      at times unhealthy body ideals.
   Segment 128
      0:10:33.600000 ---> 0:10:39.640000
      In her foreword, she notes that despite all of her research, despite her awareness, her
   Segment 129
      0:10:39.640000 ---> 0:10:45.960000
      rational understanding that beauty is a cultural construct, she too nonetheless falls victim
   Segment 130
      0:10:45.960000 ---> 0:10:48.040000
      to these pressures.
   Segment 131
      0:10:48.040000 ---> 0:10:55
      The point being that cultural ideologies are powerful, and are difficult to escape.
   Segment 132
      0:10:55 ---> 0:11:01.680000
      One makes choices, but our choices are severely limited by our culture, and we all conform
   Segment 133
      0:11:01.680000 ---> 0:11:03.640000
      one way or another.
   Segment 134
      0:11:03.640000 ---> 0:11:10.360000
      Alright, in conclusion, Henry P. Robinson's Fading Away is a fine art combination print
   Segment 135
      0:11:10.360000 ---> 0:11:15.440000
      photograph that depicts a young woman dying of tuberculosis.
   Segment 136
      0:11:15.440000 ---> 0:11:20.640000
      Rather than the good death, this image seems to instead feature the beautiful death, the
   Segment 137
      0:11:20.640000 ---> 0:11:25.480000
      death characterized by an erotic ache.
   Segment 138
      0:11:25.480000 ---> 0:11:31.280000
      Whereas viewers today are likely to see this as a family tragedy, folks from the time understood
   Segment 139
      0:11:31.280000 ---> 0:11:36.760000
      the man in the back to be the young woman's husband or perhaps lover.
   Segment 140
      0:11:36.760000 ---> 0:11:42.080000
      Robinson's exhibition of the main figure under the title she never told her love seems to
   Segment 141
      0:11:42.080000 ---> 0:11:44.640000
      support this interpretation.
   Segment 142
      0:11:44.640000 ---> 0:11:51
      Victorians regarded tuberculosis as a romantic and even sensual disease that made one more
   Segment 143
      0:11:51 ---> 0:11:53.440000
      beautiful as they approached death.
   Segment 144
      0:11:53.440000 ---> 0:12:00.640000
      A thought gritched dovetailed nicely with contemporary feminine ideals regarding passivity.
   Segment 145
      0:12:00.640000 ---> 0:12:06.920000
      Through death, the young woman in Fading Away becomes an eternal embodiment of this ideal.
   Segment 146
      0:12:06.920000 ---> 0:12:12.520000
      Importantly, this ideal had serious tangible consequences for women, in that it prized
   Segment 147
      0:12:12.520000 ---> 0:12:17.240000
      frailty, delicacy and weakness to the point of illness.

Transcription for audio3.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:05.760000
      In this video, we are going to discuss John Everett Malaives of Philia.
   Segment 2
      0:00:05.760000 ---> 0:00:10.200000
      Just a quick content warning, this video contains discussion of suicide and medical
   Segment 3
      0:00:10.200000 ---> 0:00:12.240000
      violence.
   Segment 4
      0:00:12.240000 ---> 0:00:19.160000
      The 19th century is characterized by intensifying nationalism, wherein European nations celebrated
   Segment 5
      0:00:19.160000 ---> 0:00:24.640000
      not just their state, but sought to define a unique national character.
   Segment 6
      0:00:24.640000 ---> 0:00:28.880000
      One of the ways that this manifests in the art of the UK is through an interest in the
   Segment 7
      0:00:28.880000 ---> 0:00:30.880000
      medieval past.
   Segment 8
      0:00:30.880000 ---> 0:00:35.800000
      Nowhere is this more visible than among the artists associated with the pre-Raphaelite
   Segment 9
      0:00:35.800000 ---> 0:00:41.600000
      Brotherhood, whose membership included Malay, shown here on the left.
   Segment 10
      0:00:41.600000 ---> 0:00:46.880000
      The pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood indulged in a nostalgia for the medieval pre-enlightenment
   Segment 11
      0:00:46.880000 ---> 0:00:53.920000
      past, which they saw as a simpler, more authentic, and more spiritual time.
   Segment 12
      0:00:53.920000 ---> 0:00:58.200000
      Malay's pre-Raphaelite paintings often feature young women with faraway looks and wilting
   Segment 13
      0:00:58.200000 ---> 0:01:00.200000
      poses.
   Segment 14
      0:01:00.200000 ---> 0:01:06
      In terms of subject matter, UK artists of this era often preferred themes that were distinctly
   Segment 15
      0:01:06 ---> 0:01:12.440000
      English and laden with chivalrous romance, culling figures from Shakespeare, King Arthur
   Segment 16
      0:01:12.440000 ---> 0:01:18.360000
      and the Knights of the Round Table, and the writings of Lord Alfred Tennyson.
   Segment 17
      0:01:18.360000 ---> 0:01:23.560000
      One of the most popular subjects to emerge was that of a Philia, though a fairly minor
   Segment 18
      0:01:23.560000 ---> 0:01:29.840000
      character in Shakespeare's Hamlet, Ophelia was the 19th century's absolute fave, far
   Segment 19
      0:01:29.840000 ---> 0:01:33.720000
      surpassing even Hamlet himself in popularity.
   Segment 20
      0:01:33.720000 ---> 0:01:39.920000
      In the play, Ophelia is a friend and would-be love interest of Hamlet's, but after he rejected
   Segment 21
      0:01:39.920000 ---> 0:01:46.760000
      her by cruelly declaring, get lead to a nunnery, and the subsequent murder of her father,
   Segment 22
      0:01:46.760000 ---> 0:01:50.240000
      Ophelia experiences a mental break.
   Segment 23
      0:01:50.240000 ---> 0:01:55.920000
      She begins talking in strange rhymes, singing songs about death and the loss of innocence,
   Segment 24
      0:01:55.920000 ---> 0:02:00.840000
      and handing out flowers while obsessing over their symbolic meanings.
   Segment 25
      0:02:00.840000 ---> 0:02:05.120000
      Although we do not actually see her death scene, we are later told through a second-hand
   Segment 26
      0:02:05.120000 ---> 0:02:10.600000
      account that Ophelia has killed herself by drowning in a brook.
   Segment 27
      0:02:10.600000 ---> 0:02:17.240000
      Iconographically, artists often expressed Ophelia's so-called madness pictorially through loose
   Segment 28
      0:02:17.240000 ---> 0:02:23.720000
      uncapped hair, and the flowers from her farewell scene, to which she still claims.
   Segment 29
      0:02:23.720000 ---> 0:02:28.920000
      When depicting this story, the pre-Raphaelites tended to locate Ophelia squarely at the center
   Segment 30
      0:02:28.920000 ---> 0:02:35.040000
      of the drama, with primary emphasis on the emotive qualities of her role, namely that
   Segment 31
      0:02:35.040000 ---> 0:02:38.520000
      of her quote-unquote madness.
   Segment 32
      0:02:38.520000 ---> 0:02:44.240000
      In that these images tend to romanticize and even emphasize the sensuality of Ophelia's
   Segment 33
      0:02:44.240000 ---> 0:02:50.640000
      suicide, they constitute depictions of the Victorian beautiful death, a trope that typically
   Segment 34
      0:02:50.640000 ---> 0:02:57.080000
      describes literary and artistic representations of young women whose youth, beauty, and erotic
   Segment 35
      0:02:57.080000 ---> 0:03:02.400000
      allure seem all the more heightened by their connection to mortality.
   Segment 36
      0:03:02.400000 ---> 0:03:07.720000
      As in other examples of the beautiful death from the 19th century, Ophelia's suicide
   Segment 37
      0:03:07.720000 ---> 0:03:13.640000
      was taken as evidence of her essential feminine purity, a reaffirmation of her innocence in
   Segment 38
      0:03:13.640000 ---> 0:03:17.720000
      the face of Hamlet's abuse and sexual rebuff.
   Segment 39
      0:03:17.720000 ---> 0:03:23.240000
      Insanity and death were often treated during this era as the logical outcome for a woman
   Segment 40
      0:03:23.240000 ---> 0:03:27.400000
      with unchecked or unrequited romantic longing.
   Segment 41
      0:03:27.400000 ---> 0:03:32.900000
      The English poet Lord Alfred Tennyson's Lady of Shilat, for example, floated hopelessly
   Segment 42
      0:03:32.900000 ---> 0:03:39.760000
      downstream to her death in search of Sir Lancelot, who would never return her affections.
   Segment 43
      0:03:39.760000 ---> 0:03:43.800000
      In Melay's version, we see Ophelia already in the water.
   Segment 44
      0:03:43.800000 ---> 0:03:47.600000
      Viewers from the time interpreted her as already dead.
   Segment 45
      0:03:47.600000 ---> 0:03:52.920000
      The lush vegetation that surrounds her seems impossibly green, blossoming all the more at
   Segment 46
      0:03:52.920000 ---> 0:03:55.280000
      her presence.
   Segment 47
      0:03:55.280000 ---> 0:04:00.840000
      Natural fertility has long been used in Western art as a symbolic reference to human sexuality
   Segment 48
      0:04:00.840000 ---> 0:04:03.840000
      and procreative potential.
   Segment 49
      0:04:03.840000 ---> 0:04:10.160000
      The flowers once grasped by her now relaxed hand float freely, starting with a small pink
   Segment 50
      0:04:10.160000 ---> 0:04:16.140000
      bud by her ear and then floating in a serpentine line toward her feet, as if representing
   Segment 51
      0:04:16.140000 ---> 0:04:18.760000
      thoughts leaving her head.
   Segment 52
      0:04:18.760000 ---> 0:04:24.560000
      In death, her flowers become signs of her spiritual powers, powers that we are told she
   Segment 53
      0:04:24.560000 ---> 0:04:27.720000
      was unable to control in life.
   Segment 54
      0:04:27.720000 ---> 0:04:33.080000
      As is typical in the beautiful death, Melay chooses to emphasize her physical appeal.
   Segment 55
      0:04:33.080000 ---> 0:04:38.360000
      Her lips parting as if gasping, perhaps even organically panting.
   Segment 56
      0:04:38.360000 ---> 0:04:44.040000
      Her midsection sinks into the water, creating an exaggerated hourglass figure.
   Segment 57
      0:04:44.040000 ---> 0:04:49.480000
      Although she is almost certainly meant to be interpreted as dead, she, frankly, doesn't
   Segment 58
      0:04:49.480000 ---> 0:04:52.200000
      look much like a drowned corpse.
   Segment 59
      0:04:52.200000 ---> 0:04:54.640000
      Her face is pale but not discolored.
   Segment 60
      0:04:54.640000 ---> 0:04:59.720000
      Her body is not yet hard with rigamordous or bloated with air, a state that would cause
   Segment 61
      0:04:59.720000 ---> 0:05:03.360000
      her stomach to buoy up to the surface of the water.
   Segment 62
      0:05:03.360000 ---> 0:05:10
      In a later review from 1874, one art critic lauded Melay's decision to forgo grim anatomical
   Segment 63
      0:05:10 ---> 0:05:11
      accuracy.
   Segment 64
      0:05:11 ---> 0:05:15.800000
      Quote, Malay's a philia has a beautiful, wild face.
   Segment 65
      0:05:15.800000 ---> 0:05:21.680000
      Full of sensibility, the eyes opened but not staring, the mouth is parted, her form is
   Segment 66
      0:05:21.680000 ---> 0:05:27.080000
      wholly submerged except for the head, as a body would float in life.
   Segment 67
      0:05:27.080000 ---> 0:05:31.400000
      And a great awkwardness of position is saved by this treatment.
   Segment 68
      0:05:31.400000 ---> 0:05:36.960000
      The banks and trees around are one mass of beauty, flowers bloom, willow boughs droop
   Segment 69
      0:05:36.960000 ---> 0:05:45.280000
      tenderly, and these lovely details soften the pain of the beautiful dead face.
   Segment 70
      0:05:45.280000 ---> 0:05:50.560000
      Since the Renaissance era, viewers of Western art were accustomed to seeing images of unconscious
   Segment 71
      0:05:50.560000 ---> 0:05:53.480000
      women intended for visual pleasure.
   Segment 72
      0:05:53.480000 ---> 0:05:58.600000
      Whereas a conscious woman might look back accusatorily, making one aware of their own
   Segment 73
      0:05:58.600000 ---> 0:06:05.960000
      intrusion, implicated, an unconscious individual in art feels more unthreatening, seemingly
   Segment 74
      0:06:05.960000 ---> 0:06:08.040000
      open to our gaze.
   Segment 75
      0:06:08.040000 ---> 0:06:12.760000
      The beautiful death it seems was the logical extreme of this tradition.
   Segment 76
      0:06:12.760000 ---> 0:06:17.560000
      What's more passive after all than a dead body?
   Segment 77
      0:06:17.560000 ---> 0:06:22.720000
      In 19th century culture, a woman's death was regarded as the ultimate expression of
   Segment 78
      0:06:22.720000 ---> 0:06:25.440000
      feminine passivity and weakness.
   Segment 79
      0:06:25.440000 ---> 0:06:31.120000
      The cult of the invalid, meaning the romanticization of illness in women, held that bodily and
   Segment 80
      0:06:31.120000 ---> 0:06:35.480000
      physical vigor, were indicative of masculinity.
   Segment 81
      0:06:35.480000 ---> 0:06:39.920000
      Within this worldview, folks believed that women were more prone to physical as well
   Segment 82
      0:06:39.920000 ---> 0:06:41.840000
      as mental illness.
   Segment 83
      0:06:41.840000 ---> 0:06:48.040000
      Indeed, so-called madness in 19th century Europe was closely tied to gender.
   Segment 84
      0:06:48.120000 ---> 0:06:53.880000
      Victorian doctors tended to divide mental illness in men into three main categories,
   Segment 85
      0:06:53.880000 ---> 0:07:00.280000
      the insane genius, criminal insanity, and masturbatory insanity, really.
   Segment 86
      0:07:00.280000 ---> 0:07:04.880000
      For women, there was really only one diagnosis, hysteria.
   Segment 87
      0:07:04.880000 ---> 0:07:10.240000
      There were now debunked field of psychology, 19th century doctors described hysteria as
   Segment 88
      0:07:10.240000 ---> 0:07:15.800000
      a disease of the nerves, rather than a detached and floating uterus which was the previous
   Segment 89
      0:07:15.800000 ---> 0:07:17.720000
      explanation.
   Segment 90
      0:07:17.720000 ---> 0:07:24
      In practice, hysteria was a catch-all diagnosis for all mental illness in women, but also
   Segment 91
      0:07:24 ---> 0:07:29.440000
      for those who just didn't quite conform to cultural norms, who didn't fit into the boxes
   Segment 92
      0:07:29.440000 ---> 0:07:32.680000
      that society had established for them.
   Segment 93
      0:07:32.680000 ---> 0:07:39.160000
      Indeed, many first-wave feminists wound up institutionalized for their social rebellions.
   Segment 94
      0:07:39.160000 ---> 0:07:45.080000
      Whereas men and women were institutionalized at psychiatric facilities at similar rates,
   Segment 95
      0:07:45.080000 ---> 0:07:50.440000
      women were far more likely to stay for long periods, sometimes decades.
   Segment 96
      0:07:50.440000 ---> 0:07:55.040000
      For a woman to be institutionalized in France, for example, all it took was the signature
   Segment 97
      0:07:55.040000 ---> 0:07:59.600000
      of a male family member, with or without doctor approval.
   Segment 98
      0:07:59.600000 ---> 0:08:06.280000
      19th century women internalized and learned to idealize these stereotypes, a phenomenon
   Segment 99
      0:08:06.280000 ---> 0:08:10.200000
      mocked by the sardonic French cartoonist, Domier.
   Segment 100
      0:08:10.200000 ---> 0:08:15.560000
      The Blue Stockings Club was a widespread women's reading group that gave women an outlet for
   Segment 101
      0:08:15.560000 ---> 0:08:22.240000
      intellectual stimulation, and also functioned as an early hub for first-wave feminism.
   Segment 102
      0:08:22.240000 ---> 0:08:27.800000
      In this illustration, a woman departs, saying, Goodbye Ophelia, don't miss Tuesday night,
   Segment 103
      0:08:27.800000 ---> 0:08:30.840000
      will read elegies and make mold wine.
   Segment 104
      0:08:30.840000 ---> 0:08:34.440000
      Never minding how delightfully witchy that all sounds?
   Segment 105
      0:08:34.440000 ---> 0:08:39.800000
      Domier's joke here is that these educated women are nonetheless glamorizing their own
   Segment 106
      0:08:39.800000 ---> 0:08:44.400000
      death in order to match the feminine cultural ideal.
   Segment 107
      0:08:44.400000 ---> 0:08:50.040000
      As artistic subject matter, Ophelia seemed to appeal to men and women alike.
   Segment 108
      0:08:50.040000 ---> 0:08:54.720000
      On the right, we see a fine art photograph by Julia Margaret Cameron that depicts one
   Segment 109
      0:08:54.720000 ---> 0:09:00.480000
      of her daughters with hair loose and wild, a faraway look, and a flowered hat meant to
   Segment 110
      0:09:00.480000 ---> 0:09:03.700000
      remind viewers of her final moments.
   Segment 111
      0:09:03.700000 ---> 0:09:07.860000
      As the century rolled on, Ophelia only grew in popularity.
   Segment 112
      0:09:07.860000 ---> 0:09:12.780000
      Here are a couple of examples from Turn of the Century French Art.
   Segment 113
      0:09:12.780000 ---> 0:09:19.460000
      In conclusion, Ophelia was a hugely popular subject matter in 19th century European art.
   Segment 114
      0:09:19.460000 ---> 0:09:24.420000
      The theme, borrowed from Shakespeare's Hamlet, was employed in art as an extension of the
   Segment 115
      0:09:24.420000 ---> 0:09:27.300000
      beautiful death, or the cult of the invalid.
   Segment 116
      0:09:27.300000 ---> 0:09:32.580000
      A cultural trope, which characterized death and illness, as markers of ideal feminine
   Segment 117
      0:09:32.580000 ---> 0:09:34.620000
      beauty and decorum.
   Segment 118
      0:09:34.620000 ---> 0:09:40.740000
      In England, Ophelia's popularity was strengthened thanks to nationalist claims on Shakespeare's
   Segment 119
      0:09:40.740000 ---> 0:09:41.740000
      legacy.
   Segment 120
      0:09:41.740000 ---> 0:09:47.820000
      John Everett Malay's painting in particular romanticizes her suicide, depicting her lifeless
   Segment 121
      0:09:47.820000 ---> 0:09:53.020000
      body as sensual and passively available for her viewing pleasure.
   Segment 122
      0:09:53.020000 ---> 0:09:57.380000
      Images like this one helped to reinforce the harmful stereotype that women were prone
   Segment 123
      0:09:57.380000 ---> 0:09:59.500000
      to so-called hysteria.
   Segment 124
      0:09:59.500000 ---> 0:10:04.900000
      This now debunked field of psychology was arbitrarily invoked to wrongfully justify
   Segment 125
      0:10:04.900000 ---> 0:10:07.220000
      the forced institutionalization of women.

Transcription for audio4.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:05
      In this video, we will discuss Edmonia Lewis' The Death of Cleopatra.
   Segment 2
      0:00:05 ---> 0:00:09
      Before we get started, I just wanted to issue a quick content warning
   Segment 3
      0:00:09 ---> 0:00:14
      that this video contains reference to racial violence and suicide.
   Segment 4
      0:00:14 ---> 0:00:19
      Before we look at the sculpture itself, I think it will be helpful in this case
   Segment 5
      0:00:19 ---> 0:00:25
      to know a bit more about the artist's background and the general social climate in which she was working.
   Segment 6
      0:00:25 ---> 0:00:32
      Before the last couple of decades of the 19th century, most artists in the United States were white men.
   Segment 7
      0:00:32 ---> 0:00:37
      Some white women and black men were able to break through institutional barriers
   Segment 8
      0:00:37 ---> 0:00:44
      that made it difficult for them to become professional artists, but it was initially quite rare.
   Segment 9
      0:00:44 ---> 0:00:49
      Women who managed to become professional working artists were typically white
   Segment 10
      0:00:49 ---> 0:00:53
      and tended to come from the middle or upper middle classes.
   Segment 11
      0:00:53 ---> 0:00:56
      Edmonia Lewis is an exception to that.
   Segment 12
      0:00:56 ---> 0:01:01
      Throughout Edmonia Lewis' career, she pushed against the professional barriers
   Segment 13
      0:01:01 ---> 0:01:05
      that often worked to hold women back from careers in the professional arts,
   Segment 14
      0:01:05 ---> 0:01:09
      which were, by the way, more severe when it came to sculpture,
   Segment 15
      0:01:09 ---> 0:01:14
      because it was seen as a more physical and therefore more masculine trade.
   Segment 16
      0:01:14 ---> 0:01:19
      She also pushed against the myriad social boundaries that had been set in place
   Segment 17
      0:01:19 ---> 0:01:24
      to hold black Americans back culturally, socially, professionally.
   Segment 18
      0:01:24 ---> 0:01:26
      She was a mixed race woman.
   Segment 19
      0:01:26 ---> 0:01:33
      Her father was a black Haitian man, and her mother had African American and Native American roots.
   Segment 20
      0:01:33 ---> 0:01:39
      She was largely raised by her aunt and her brother, who advocated for her throughout her life and career.
   Segment 21
      0:01:39 ---> 0:01:45
      Growing up, she made Native American artworks to sell to tourists to help make money,
   Segment 22
      0:01:45 ---> 0:01:51
      and her brother worked multiple jobs to help earn a living and support Edmonia's goals.
   Segment 23
      0:01:51 ---> 0:01:55
      She entered into school and was soon recognized as a talent.
   Segment 24
      0:01:55 ---> 0:02:00
      Abolitionists, individuals in the U.S., who had advocated to abolish slavery
   Segment 25
      0:02:00 ---> 0:02:04
      and thereafter worked toward the equality of black Americans,
   Segment 26
      0:02:04 ---> 0:02:07
      began to commission works from Lewis.
   Segment 27
      0:02:07 ---> 0:02:12
      They gave her funds that enabled her to enter into Oberlin College in Ohio.
   Segment 28
      0:02:12 ---> 0:02:18
      That said, the white abolitionists who helped Lewis did not do so unconditionally.
   Segment 29
      0:02:18 ---> 0:02:25
      The assistance was qualified, and Lewis became frustrated by being tokenized as a black artist.
   Segment 30
      0:02:25 ---> 0:02:31
      Oberlin College was a progressive university that was, in fact, the first school in the nation
   Segment 31
      0:02:31 ---> 0:02:35
      to have black women and white men learning in the same classroom.
   Segment 32
      0:02:35 ---> 0:02:39
      She received a lot of support and encouragement from the school itself,
   Segment 33
      0:02:39 ---> 0:02:47
      but also received harassment from some of her fellow students and folks living in the surrounding area in Ohio.
   Segment 34
      0:02:47 ---> 0:02:51
      One night, she was accused on trumped-up charges of theft,
   Segment 35
      0:02:51 ---> 0:02:56
      and she was taken into a field beat and left for dead.
   Segment 36
      0:02:56 ---> 0:03:00
      Soon after this incident, Edmonia Lewis quit Oberlin College
   Segment 37
      0:03:00 ---> 0:03:06
      and decided to move abroad to Europe, where she hoped she would be able to work on her own terms,
   Segment 38
      0:03:06 ---> 0:03:13
      and where she would be less likely to face the kind of racism and violence that she endured in the United States.
   Segment 39
      0:03:13 ---> 0:03:16
      In her own words, she desired, quote,
   Segment 40
      0:03:16 ---> 0:03:21
      to find a social atmosphere where she was not constantly reminded of her color.
   Segment 41
      0:03:21 ---> 0:03:25
      The land of liberty had no room for a black sculptor.
   Segment 42
      0:03:25 ---> 0:03:29
      This is not to say that Europe was without prejudice,
   Segment 43
      0:03:29 ---> 0:03:36
      but rather that Europe during these years didn't have the same widespread history of racially motivated violence.
   Segment 44
      0:03:36 ---> 0:03:41
      The move would also allow her to use her art to address race on her own terms,
   Segment 45
      0:03:41 ---> 0:03:46
      rather than guided by the preference of white abolitionist patrons.
   Segment 46
      0:03:46 ---> 0:03:52
      Lewis settled in Rome where she began hanging out with American expat artists.
   Segment 47
      0:03:52 ---> 0:03:58
      Rome had also provided her with a plethora of high-quality marble to work with.
   Segment 48
      0:03:58 ---> 0:04:05
      Ultimately, she made a really good career for herself there, receiving many large sales and prominent commissions.
   Segment 49
      0:04:05 ---> 0:04:11
      She continued to occasionally make works that offered commentary on U.S. political happenings
   Segment 50
      0:04:11 ---> 0:04:14
      and took commissions from American patrons.
   Segment 51
      0:04:14 ---> 0:04:23
      Edmonia Lewis was trained in neo-classicism and would have had many resources and points of inspiration in Rome.
   Segment 52
      0:04:23 ---> 0:04:33
      Lewis's The Death of Cleopatra was sculpted for the Centennial International Exhibition of 1876, held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
   Segment 53
      0:04:33 ---> 0:04:41
      International exhibitions were large fairs, intended to showcase achievements of the invited nations.
   Segment 54
      0:04:41 ---> 0:04:50
      They were seen as an opportunity for nations, especially the host country, to show off the best examples of their art, their science, etc.
   Segment 55
      0:04:50 ---> 0:04:57
      Lewis successfully submitted and subsequently exhibited multiple works to the U.S. Centennial Pavilion.
   Segment 56
      0:04:57 ---> 0:05:03
      But it was The Death of Cleopatra that attracted the most attention by far.
   Segment 57
      0:05:03 ---> 0:05:11
      The Death of Cleopatra depicts the death of a real historical figure, but the narrative is not based around fact.
   Segment 58
      0:05:11 ---> 0:05:22
      The story told here was actually one made famous by Shakespeare's fictionalized retelling, where in the Egyptian Queen allows herself to be bitten by a poisonous asp,
   Segment 59
      0:05:22 ---> 0:05:28
      choosing to kill herself rather than being imprisoned and humiliated by Roman conquerors.
   Segment 60
      0:05:28 ---> 0:05:34
      The Death of Cleopatra was a pretty popular subject in 19th century Western art.
   Segment 61
      0:05:34 ---> 0:05:40
      In fact, Lewis's was not even the only Cleopatra at the Centennial.
   Segment 62
      0:05:40 ---> 0:05:52
      Most of the time, artists chose to depict this subject either before her death, like in the case of Story Sculpture, which shows the moment wherein Cleopatra is contemplating her demise,
   Segment 63
      0:05:52 ---> 0:05:59
      or they chose to depict her fully after her death, as she lays passive and motionless on her throne.
   Segment 64
      0:06:00 ---> 0:06:07
      When Lewis's statue was displayed, viewers recognized that they were looking at something fairly unique.
   Segment 65
      0:06:07 ---> 0:06:12
      They were looking at an image of Cleopatra in the exact moment of her death.
   Segment 66
      0:06:12 ---> 0:06:23
      As art historian Susanna W. Gould describes it, quote, with her head thrown back in anguish and her slightly parted lips and eyes still registering pain,
   Segment 67
      0:06:23 ---> 0:06:30
      Cleopatra collapses into her throne, just as the last pulse of energy drains from her body.
   Segment 68
      0:06:30 ---> 0:06:41
      While the asp twists through her motionless right hand, the agitation in her left arm is barely but notably perceptible as it falls to her side,
   Segment 69
      0:06:41 ---> 0:06:45
      resulting in a haunting impression of the very moment of death.
   Segment 70
      0:06:46 ---> 0:06:54
      The sculpture was prominently placed, and quite a few reviewers made reference to it. Most were pretty critical of it.
   Segment 71
      0:06:54 ---> 0:07:03
      Why? Why was this large, impressively rendered, and fairly original sculpture of a popular subject, reviewed so poorly,
   Segment 72
      0:07:04 ---> 0:07:15
      referred to as disagreeable and, quote, positively repellent, ghastly, an unusual contorted figure with a weird, desperate expression.
   Segment 73
      0:07:16 ---> 0:07:29
      Well, the reason is probably multifold. First, witnessing the Queen's actual moment of death was seen as somehow more grotesque, more gruesome, than if she were an actual corpse.
   Segment 74
      0:07:30 ---> 0:07:35
      She seems to slightly rise in pain, or maybe even ecstasy?
   Segment 75
      0:07:36 ---> 0:07:48
      The second, and I think more interesting reason that this work was controversial, probably had to do with the complicated ways that Americans regarded the figure of Cleopatra and Egypt more broadly.
   Segment 76
      0:07:49 ---> 0:07:54
      And I'll just warn you here that this is a little bit complicated, so bear with me.
   Segment 77
      0:07:55 ---> 0:08:04
      In the 19th century, Western nations were undergoing a phenomenon some have called Egyptomania, a cultural fascination with ancient Egyptian culture.
   Segment 78
      0:08:05 ---> 0:08:12
      Europeans and white Americans viewed Egypt as a land at once familiar, but also alluringly strange.
   Segment 79
      0:08:13 ---> 0:08:23
      Although it's an African nation, the West has often claimed Egypt's history for itself, figuratively annexing its culture as part of the legacy of Western greatness.
   Segment 80
      0:08:25 ---> 0:08:33
      Still, trying to have it both ways, folks in the West nonetheless characterized Egypt as exotic and dangerous.
   Segment 81
      0:08:34 ---> 0:08:46
      All of these stereotypes became deeply ingrained within Western Egyptology of the 19th century, wherein early archaeologists projected their racial biases onto the ancient culture.
   Segment 82
      0:08:47 ---> 0:08:58
      Though these scholars acknowledged that Egypt was a mixed race society, they argued that those with darker skin tones were relegated to the lowest levels of the social order.
   Segment 83
      0:08:59 ---> 0:09:10
      This, by the way, is not borne out by current evidence or wisdom, and the racial dynamics within ancient Egypt cannot be equated to contemporary concepts of black or white.
   Segment 84
      0:09:11 ---> 0:09:21
      However, when lauding Egypt's greatness, 19th century Egyptologists prejudiced saw that greatness as evidence of the society's whiteness.
   Segment 85
      0:09:22 ---> 0:09:35
      Then, when discussing Egypt's decadence, it's penchant at times for violence and cruelty, white Egyptologists saw these aspects of Egyptian society as evidence of Egypt's otherness, its blackness.
   Segment 86
      0:09:36 ---> 0:09:44
      In other words, white historians saw Egypt through a lens of their own making, of their own biased worldview.
   Segment 87
      0:09:45 ---> 0:09:52
      Mid-century black intellectuals adamantly countered the racial stereotypes present in Egyptology of the day.
   Segment 88
      0:09:53 ---> 0:10:00
      Many within abolitionist circles held Egyptian society up as evidence of the greatness of African peoples.
   Segment 89
      0:10:01 ---> 0:10:10
      Whereas white Egyptologists typically described leaders like Cleopatra as decidedly white, black scholars opposed this assumption.
   Segment 90
      0:10:11 ---> 0:10:21
      Still, just to make this even more complicated, others within the black American community viewed Egypt as a potent allegory for American inequality.
   Segment 91
      0:10:22 ---> 0:10:30
      Egypt, after all, was notoriously society supported by conscripted slave labor, something which features prominently in the Christian Bible.
   Segment 92
      0:10:31 ---> 0:10:39
      This is perhaps most famously codified in the well-known plantation spiritual, Go Down Moses, which demands, quote,
   Segment 93
      0:10:39 ---> 0:10:43
      way down in Egypt land, tell old Pharaoh, let my people go.
   Segment 94
      0:10:44 ---> 0:10:49
      Pharaoh, in this case, being a metaphorical stand-in for the American slave owner.
   Segment 95
      0:10:50 ---> 0:10:58
      When describing her escape from enslavement, Sordraner Truth, an important abolitionist and feminist of the 19th century, said, quote,
   Segment 96
      0:10:59 ---> 0:11:03
      I left everything behind. I wasn't going to keep nothing of Egypt on me.
   Segment 97
      0:11:04 ---> 0:11:08
      So what version of Egypt do we see in Lewis's retelling?
   Segment 98
      0:11:08 ---> 0:11:14
      Reviewers of her work described this Cleopatra as distinctly Roman in appearance.
   Segment 99
      0:11:14 ---> 0:11:16
      So what's the problem with that?
   Segment 100
      0:11:17 ---> 0:11:21
      Well, Lewis doesn't idealize or romanticize her subject.
   Segment 101
      0:11:21 ---> 0:11:26
      Instead, viewers of this time period recognized the Queen's agony.
   Segment 102
      0:11:26 ---> 0:11:30
      They described her as not handsome enough, as ghastly.
   Segment 103
      0:11:31 ---> 0:11:39
      In refusing to idealize, art historians Susanna Gold argues that Lewis depicted her Cleopatra as nothing but a dying white slave owner.
   Segment 104
      0:11:40 ---> 0:11:48
      Quote, in her incarnation as a white queen, Lewis's Cleopatra can be read as the Egyptian old Pharaoh of spirituals,
   Segment 105
      0:11:49 ---> 0:11:55
      the quintessential slave owner, whose legendary empire was built on the backs of a subjugated people.
   Segment 106
      0:11:56 ---> 0:12:05
      It's worth noting here that Lewis resists depicting slavery outright, as was common actually in European depictions of the theme.
   Segment 107
      0:12:06 ---> 0:12:20
      Because Egyptians were temporally removed and seen as culturally other, Europeans used images of Egypt as a space wherein they could create romanticized images of slavery that could be mentally divorced,
   Segment 108
      0:12:21 ---> 0:12:24
      distanced from their own participation within the African slave trade.
   Segment 109
      0:12:25 ---> 0:12:36
      In these scenes, we often see Cleopatra rendered highly beautiful by Western beauty standards, surrounded by devoted slaves who continue to serve their queen even in death.
   Segment 110
      0:12:37 ---> 0:12:46
      It makes sense that Lewis would want to avoid such depictions, which were often lauded by reviewers as beautiful depictions of sacrifice and loyalty.
   Segment 111
      0:12:47 ---> 0:12:50
      Now, one last thing I want to consider is context.
   Segment 112
      0:12:50 ---> 0:12:54
      The Centennial celebration was a place of popular entertainment.
   Segment 113
      0:12:55 ---> 0:13:00
      More than 10 million visitors from across the globe filed through its exhibits.
   Segment 114
      0:13:01 ---> 0:13:04
      It was also a space that was categorically patriotic.
   Segment 115
      0:13:05 ---> 0:13:13
      It was the first official world's fair on US soil, therefore an important opportunity for the country to establish itself on the world stage.
   Segment 116
      0:13:14 ---> 0:13:21
      As a Centennial Fair, it also commemorated the 100th anniversary of the nation's founding.
   Segment 117
      0:13:22 ---> 0:13:29
      What might be less obvious to us today, but would have been palpable at the time, was the fair's connection to the Civil War.
   Segment 118
      0:13:30 ---> 0:13:33
      The event was held just 11 years after the war's end.
   Segment 119
      0:13:34 ---> 0:13:42
      Though more than a decade passed, the nation was still in the process of reconstruction, still working towards re-envisioning itself as a unified name.
   Segment 120
      0:13:44 ---> 0:13:47
      This piece was still seen as a delicate one.
   Segment 121
      0:13:48 ---> 0:13:55
      For this reason, organizers of the Centennial obsessively avoided any mention of slavery or emancipation.
   Segment 122
      0:13:56 ---> 0:14:02
      As any visual evidence of even Black citizenship was feared as too contentious, too dangerous.
   Segment 123
      0:14:03 ---> 0:14:12
      Reminders of America's legacy of slavery would have also thrown into clear relief the hypocrisy at the very heart of the Centennial celebration.
   Segment 124
      0:14:13 ---> 0:14:18
      The celebration of a nation founded on the stated principles of liberty and equality for all.
   Segment 125
      0:14:20 ---> 0:14:27
      Within this climate, Louis as a Black artist could not have submitted a sculpture that spoke directly of Black empowerment.
   Segment 126
      0:14:28 ---> 0:14:33
      Instead, she found a way to offer subtle metaphorical commentary on American culture.
   Segment 127
      0:14:34 ---> 0:14:38
      One last time in the words of Susanna Gold, quote,
   Segment 128
      0:14:38 ---> 0:14:49
      depicted as an unsightly twisted and decaying figure, this plantation mistress, at her fatal demise, evokes the destruction of African slavery in the United States.
   Segment 129
      0:14:50 ---> 0:14:56
      In conclusion, Edmonia Lewis was an American sculptor with Black and Native American heritage.
   Segment 130
      0:14:57 ---> 0:15:03
      Working during a time wherein it was difficult for a woman to become a professional artist, let alone a mixed race woman.
   Segment 131
      0:15:04 ---> 0:15:14
      Nevertheless, she overcame these institutional and cultural obstacles, eventually moving to Rome where she successfully made a life and career for herself.
   Segment 132
      0:15:15 ---> 0:15:27
      In 1876, Lewis exhibited her death of Cleopatra at the Centennial International Exhibition, an event loaded with patriotic undertones and post Civil War tensions.
   Segment 133
      0:15:28 ---> 0:15:37
      Just a little more than a decade following the end of the Civil War, Lewis telling the chose to focus on the figure of Cleopatra, an African queen,
   Segment 134
      0:15:37 ---> 0:15:46
      but did so in such a way that her sculpture offered quiet commentary on the legacy and violent death of slavery in the United States.

Transcription for audio5.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:05.800000
      In this video, we are going to discuss Thomas Akins' The Gross Clinic.
   Segment 2
      0:00:05.800000 ---> 0:00:11.720000
      Before we get started, a quick content warning here that this discussion will be a disturbing
   Segment 3
      0:00:11.720000 ---> 0:00:19.720000
      one, involving grave robbing, medical violence, and animal cruelty.
   Segment 4
      0:00:19.720000 ---> 0:00:24.360000
      Before we dive into the image itself, which depicts a live surgery, I want to take a
   Segment 5
      0:00:24.360000 ---> 0:00:32.280000
      moment to talk about the history of anatomical study dissection in its relationship to art.
   Segment 6
      0:00:32.280000 ---> 0:00:36.560000
      The study of anatomy has a long tradition in Western art.
   Segment 7
      0:00:36.560000 ---> 0:00:44.320000
      Renaissance artists like Michelangelo, Paoloolo, and Mantegna attended lectures and dissections.
   Segment 8
      0:00:44.320000 ---> 0:00:49.800000
      And Leonardo da Vinci's journals are full of anatomical drawings.
   Segment 9
      0:00:49.800000 ---> 0:00:56.600000
      The Renaissance era you see highly prized strict anatomical accuracy in their art.
   Segment 10
      0:00:56.600000 ---> 0:01:01.840000
      Sometimes these practices were done legally, but the demand for medical dissection far
   Segment 11
      0:01:01.840000 ---> 0:01:09.680000
      outpaced the supply of bodies, as few cadavers were willingly donated to doctors at this time.
   Segment 12
      0:01:09.680000 ---> 0:01:15.880000
      For his part, Leonardo is rumored to have made private requests to families, to allow
   Segment 13
      0:01:15.880000 ---> 0:01:21.440000
      him to conduct post-mortem examinations on the recently deceased.
   Segment 14
      0:01:21.440000 ---> 0:01:27.200000
      Some countries like the Netherlands committed the bodies of executed criminals to science,
   Segment 15
      0:01:27.200000 ---> 0:01:34.240000
      as desecration of the body was seen at this time as the ultimate form of punishment.
   Segment 16
      0:01:34.240000 ---> 0:01:39.360000
      Unsavory as these practices were, it actually gets grimmer still.
   Segment 17
      0:01:39.360000 ---> 0:01:42.520000
      Not all anatomical study was done above board.
   Segment 18
      0:01:42.520000 ---> 0:01:48.600000
      It is a well-established fact that both artists and physicians sometimes resorted to grave
   Segment 19
      0:01:48.600000 ---> 0:01:55.080000
      robbing, or surreptitiously cutting limbs off of bodies left hanging in gallows.
   Segment 20
      0:01:55.080000 ---> 0:02:01.320000
      Those who carried out these activities were costically dubbed the Resurrection Men.
   Segment 21
      0:02:01.320000 ---> 0:02:07.240000
      Whereas today we idealize the medical profession, during these years it had a far less savory
   Segment 22
      0:02:07.240000 ---> 0:02:10.680000
      and more grisly reputation.
   Segment 23
      0:02:10.680000 ---> 0:02:17.200000
      But in the 18th century the human figure in art became more stylized elongated, switching
   Segment 24
      0:02:17.200000 ---> 0:02:22.280000
      out accuracy of the body for fashionable exaggeration.
   Segment 25
      0:02:22.280000 ---> 0:02:28.360000
      Medical study continued on, but the need for artistic anatomical study diminished.
   Segment 26
      0:02:28.360000 ---> 0:02:36.600000
      Even still, the association between art and grave robbing continued in the cultural imagination.
   Segment 27
      0:02:36.600000 ---> 0:02:41
      The only surrounding medical grave robbing came to a head in the United States in the
   Segment 28
      0:02:41 ---> 0:02:43.600000
      later 18th century.
   Segment 29
      0:02:43.600000 ---> 0:02:49.120000
      Because of bodily decomposition rates, many body thefts occurred in winter.
   Segment 30
      0:02:49.120000 ---> 0:02:56.360000
      After a particularly prolific grave robbing season in New York in 1788, a mass revolt,
   Segment 31
      0:02:56.360000 ---> 0:03:03.120000
      a crowd of more than 2,000 rose up against the local doctors and medical students.
   Segment 32
      0:03:03.120000 ---> 0:03:08.600000
      Humans had long targeted the bodies of folks with less power and privilege in society,
   Segment 33
      0:03:08.600000 ---> 0:03:14.600000
      whose graves were often shallow and unprotected, and who possessed fewer resources to fight
   Segment 34
      0:03:14.600000 ---> 0:03:17
      against these practices.
   Segment 35
      0:03:17 ---> 0:03:22.560000
      In the United States this meant that the bodies of poor whites and enslaved persons were those
   Segment 36
      0:03:22.560000 ---> 0:03:27.120000
      most commonly made victim to these illegal thefts and desecrations.
   Segment 37
      0:03:28.120000 ---> 0:03:34.160000
      It's important to note that both Christianity and practices of African ancestral veneration
   Segment 38
      0:03:34.160000 ---> 0:03:39.840000
      placed a high priority on proper treatment of the body, ensuring the soul's entry into
   Segment 39
      0:03:39.840000 ---> 0:03:42.240000
      the afterlife.
   Segment 40
      0:03:42.240000 ---> 0:03:47.840000
      With little legal recourse, the crowd broke into the hospital, whereupon they found multiple
   Segment 41
      0:03:47.840000 ---> 0:03:51.080000
      bodies in varying states of dissection.
   Segment 42
      0:03:51.080000 ---> 0:03:55.680000
      The physicians in New York were forced into hiding, and the group gathered in front of
   Segment 43
      0:03:55.680000 ---> 0:03:59.080000
      the courthouse searching for those responsible.
   Segment 44
      0:03:59.080000 ---> 0:04:06.200000
      An estimated anywhere from 6 to 20 New Yorkers were killed in the resulting chaos.
   Segment 45
      0:04:06.200000 ---> 0:04:13.120000
      Although new laws did make more bodies legally available and added clearer regulations, illegal
   Segment 46
      0:04:13.120000 ---> 0:04:19.480000
      resurrectionism continued throughout the 19th century, with sun-gree robbers even caught
   Segment 47
      0:04:19.480000 ---> 0:04:25
      brazenly transporting stolen bodies on public transportation.
   Segment 48
      0:04:25 ---> 0:04:30.440000
      In the 19th century a new art movement emerged known as realism.
   Segment 49
      0:04:30.440000 ---> 0:04:33.160000
      Realism was realistic in a couple of respects.
   Segment 50
      0:04:33.160000 ---> 0:04:39.240000
      First, they depicted the real shit, meaning the ugly realities of the world.
   Segment 51
      0:04:39.240000 ---> 0:04:42.880000
      But they also had an interest in proper anatomy.
   Segment 52
      0:04:42.880000 ---> 0:04:49.400000
      This aesthetic trend meant a renewed need for artists to participate in dissection.
   Segment 53
      0:04:49.400000 ---> 0:04:53.960000
      Thomas Ekins was a prominent American realist painter in Philadelphia.
   Segment 54
      0:04:53.960000 ---> 0:04:57.760000
      He was also kind of a troublemaker in the art world.
   Segment 55
      0:04:57.760000 ---> 0:05:02.160000
      He was famously fired from his job as the director of instruction at the Pennsylvania
   Segment 56
      0:05:02.160000 ---> 0:05:07.920000
      Academy of Fine Arts for boldly ripping the loincloth off of a male model in front of
   Segment 57
      0:05:07.920000 ---> 0:05:10.280000
      female students.
   Segment 58
      0:05:10.280000 ---> 0:05:16.440000
      The pedagogical ideals of most American art schools valued professionalism, restraint,
   Segment 59
      0:05:16.440000 ---> 0:05:19.720000
      and refinement, in addition to skill.
   Segment 60
      0:05:19.720000 ---> 0:05:26.360000
      In opposition to this, Ekins espoused a looser sort of Walt Whitman-esque attitude toward
   Segment 61
      0:05:26.360000 ---> 0:05:30.840000
      morality, societal norms, and the body.
   Segment 62
      0:05:30.840000 ---> 0:05:34.200000
      The Gross Clinic is a portrait, kind of.
   Segment 63
      0:05:34.200000 ---> 0:05:37.280000
      But it wasn't a commission, like you might assume.
   Segment 64
      0:05:37.280000 ---> 0:05:42.040000
      The title comes from the central figure's name, Dr. Gross, and it's not meant to be
   Segment 65
      0:05:42.040000 ---> 0:05:46.840000
      a description of the content, however fitting it might seem.
   Segment 66
      0:05:46.840000 ---> 0:05:52.960000
      Ekins chose to paint this scene on a massive canvas, which is a strategy sometimes employed
   Segment 67
      0:05:52.960000 ---> 0:05:56.240000
      to suggest the importance of a subject.
   Segment 68
      0:05:56.240000 ---> 0:06:01.800000
      We see Dr. Gross in the center of a surgical amphitheater, a space wherein surgical students
   Segment 69
      0:06:01.800000 ---> 0:06:07.320000
      would witness live surgeries being done as part of their education.
   Segment 70
      0:06:07.320000 ---> 0:06:13.640000
      He pauses, looks up, his hand still glistening in blood, as if perhaps to explain the process
   Segment 71
      0:06:13.640000 ---> 0:06:15.840000
      to those watching.
   Segment 72
      0:06:15.840000 ---> 0:06:20.880000
      Light falls dramatically on his forehead, one of the brightest points in the painting,
   Segment 73
      0:06:20.880000 ---> 0:06:26.480000
      which is a convention sometimes used in art to convey great intelligence.
   Segment 74
      0:06:26.480000 ---> 0:06:31.960000
      That said, to me, it also makes him look all the creepier, like someone telling a ghost
   Segment 75
      0:06:31.960000 ---> 0:06:34.560000
      story by campfire.
   Segment 76
      0:06:34.560000 ---> 0:06:39.760000
      Ekins created this work to submit to the art section of the American Centennial Exhibition
   Segment 77
      0:06:39.760000 ---> 0:06:42.520000
      of 1876.
   Segment 78
      0:06:42.520000 ---> 0:06:48.840000
      But viewers from this time were truly horrified, and it was rejected.
   Segment 79
      0:06:48.840000 ---> 0:06:55.400000
      It made it to debut instead at the Centennial, but in the medical section.
   Segment 80
      0:06:55.400000 ---> 0:06:58.480000
      A critic for the New York Tribune wrote, quote,
   Segment 81
      0:06:58.480000 ---> 0:07:04.120000
      "'For people with nerves and stomachs, the scene is so real that they might as well go
   Segment 82
      0:07:04.120000 ---> 0:07:07.760000
      into a dissection room and have it done with.'
   Segment 83
      0:07:07.760000 ---> 0:07:14.400000
      Many other critics accused him of relying on morbid shock value rather than substance.
   Segment 84
      0:07:14.400000 ---> 0:07:20.120000
      Although this painting is actually depicting a vanguard scientific procedure, a method
   Segment 85
      0:07:20.120000 ---> 0:07:26.680000
      advanced by Dr. Gross for preventing the need for amputation in patients with bone disease,
   Segment 86
      0:07:26.680000 ---> 0:07:32.320000
      this is not presented in a neutral, science-y sort of visual language.
   Segment 87
      0:07:32.320000 ---> 0:07:37.280000
      Instead, Ekins borrows strategies from the Baroque era of art.
   Segment 88
      0:07:37.280000 ---> 0:07:41.520000
      An era that employed high contrast tenibrizum.
   Segment 89
      0:07:41.520000 ---> 0:07:47.640000
      Wherein the artist uses intense highlights contrasted with deep black shadows.
   Segment 90
      0:07:47.640000 ---> 0:07:53.120000
      The individual on the table who is alive, not a cadaver, feels little more than a pile
   Segment 91
      0:07:53.120000 ---> 0:07:54.680000
      of flesh.
   Segment 92
      0:07:54.680000 ---> 0:08:00.760000
      It takes a moment, in fact, to discern what part of the body we are even looking at.
   Segment 93
      0:08:00.760000 ---> 0:08:06.560000
      Upon close inspection, Dr. Gross and his assistants are operating on a thigh, with the person
   Segment 94
      0:08:06.560000 ---> 0:08:13.280000
      lying on their side, their lower leg covered by hands and blankets in the foreground.
   Segment 95
      0:08:13.280000 ---> 0:08:18.720000
      The only indication we see of the person's head is the anesthesiologist holding a piece
   Segment 96
      0:08:18.720000 ---> 0:08:25.560000
      of cloth presumably soaked in ethanol or chloroform over the face to keep the patient subdued.
   Segment 97
      0:08:25.560000 ---> 0:08:31.920000
      Again, although a life-saving or at least leg-saving operation, in Ekins' vision of
   Segment 98
      0:08:31.920000 ---> 0:08:36.040000
      it, the whole thing feels inhuman.
   Segment 99
      0:08:36.040000 ---> 0:08:42.440000
      Even a person, the body seemingly becomes mere specimen, the subject of the doctor's
   Segment 100
      0:08:42.440000 ---> 0:08:45.280000
      blunt experimentation.
   Segment 101
      0:08:45.280000 ---> 0:08:48
      And I mean, there's a lot of blood here.
   Segment 102
      0:08:48 ---> 0:08:52.600000
      Ekins doesn't shy away from showing the harsh reality of the situation.
   Segment 103
      0:08:52.600000 ---> 0:08:58.400000
      The horror that we feel as viewers is echoed only by the cringing reaction of the woman
   Segment 104
      0:08:58.400000 ---> 0:09:00.240000
      to the left of the scene.
   Segment 105
      0:09:00.240000 ---> 0:09:03.200000
      She recoils in disgust and fear.
   Segment 106
      0:09:03.200000 ---> 0:09:09.280000
      Her claw-like hand drawn over her face, no longer able to bear the scene unfolding before
   Segment 107
      0:09:09.280000 ---> 0:09:11.360000
      her.
   Segment 108
      0:09:11.360000 ---> 0:09:16.280000
      She is presumably a relative of the patient, the mother, the wife.
   Segment 109
      0:09:16.280000 ---> 0:09:20.560000
      It's worth noting that she is the only woman in the scene, as women were not permitted
   Segment 110
      0:09:20.560000 ---> 0:09:23.680000
      to enter this space professionally.
   Segment 111
      0:09:23.680000 ---> 0:09:29.880000
      And it's interesting that Ekins has chosen to make her the emotional anchor of the story.
   Segment 112
      0:09:29.880000 ---> 0:09:36.360000
      Western culture has long stereotyped women as being more prone to emotional outbursts
   Segment 113
      0:09:36.360000 ---> 0:09:39.800000
      and sentimentality rather than rationality.
   Segment 114
      0:09:39.800000 ---> 0:09:43.320000
      And this seems to conform to that stereotype.
   Segment 115
      0:09:43.320000 ---> 0:09:49.960000
      All others in the scene react, or shall we say, do not react, with emotional stoicism.
   Segment 116
      0:09:49.960000 ---> 0:09:55.960000
      The juxtaposition of the two renders the neutral expressions cold and caring.
   Segment 117
      0:09:55.960000 ---> 0:10:00.440000
      Although it's sort of difficult to make it out, Ekins includes himself in the scene
   Segment 118
      0:10:00.440000 ---> 0:10:01.600000
      as well.
   Segment 119
      0:10:01.600000 ---> 0:10:07.480000
      You can see him in the first, fairly visible row on the far right, taking notes or perhaps
   Segment 120
      0:10:07.480000 ---> 0:10:09.160000
      sketching.
   Segment 121
      0:10:09.160000 ---> 0:10:15.320000
      Even more brazenly, Ekins places his signature on the surgical table, as if it's carved
   Segment 122
      0:10:15.320000 ---> 0:10:17.400000
      into the wood itself.
   Segment 123
      0:10:17.400000 ---> 0:10:22.920000
      He seems to be making a clear connection here between artist and medical doctor.
   Segment 124
      0:10:22.920000 ---> 0:10:27.960000
      Importantly, for understanding this painting, the dark reputation of the medical profession
   Segment 125
      0:10:27.960000 ---> 0:10:34.120000
      was renewed in the public imagination in the years during and after the US Civil War.
   Segment 126
      0:10:34.120000 ---> 0:10:41.760000
      The fast-paced and unideal nature of battlefield surgery sometimes necessitated crude amputations
   Segment 127
      0:10:41.760000 ---> 0:10:47.080000
      and surgeries that, though life-saving, would have seemed like brutal atrocities to those
   Segment 128
      0:10:47.080000 ---> 0:10:51.360000
      who witnessed them or their after effects.
   Segment 129
      0:10:51.360000 ---> 0:11:00.080000
      Every surgeon's were probably unfairly stereotyped as mere butchers, eager to chop, dubbed sawbones.
   Segment 130
      0:11:00.080000 ---> 0:11:06.380000
      As Sarah Burns puts it in her book Painting the Dark Side, quote, by 1870, the surgical
   Segment 131
      0:11:06.380000 ---> 0:11:12.040000
      profession in the United States had gained credibility as a rigorous scientific discipline.
   Segment 132
      0:11:12.040000 ---> 0:11:19.040000
      Yet, its horrific associations were difficult to shed, kept alive in part by lingering memories
   Segment 133
      0:11:19.040000 ---> 0:11:24.760000
      of the war and the epic scale of its dreadful carnage.
   Segment 134
      0:11:24.760000 ---> 0:11:31.760000
      This overpute was only deepened by intensifying debates in the later half of the 19th century,
   Segment 135
      0:11:31.760000 ---> 0:11:34.840000
      surrounding animal vivisection.
   Segment 136
      0:11:34.840000 ---> 0:11:40.240000
      Vivisection differs from dissection, in that it is practiced on live, sometimes uncidated
   Segment 137
      0:11:40.240000 ---> 0:11:43.600000
      animals rather than corpses.
   Segment 138
      0:11:43.600000 ---> 0:11:49
      Notably, Dr. Gross himself was a proponent of vivisection, having enacted it on a certain
   Segment 139
      0:11:49 ---> 0:11:51.240000
      hundreds of dogs.
   Segment 140
      0:11:51.240000 ---> 0:11:55.880000
      Those who fought against these practices argued that the medical students who participated
   Segment 141
      0:11:55.880000 ---> 0:12:02.160000
      in vivisection were corrupted by their teaching, transformed into cruel, heartless professionals,
   Segment 142
      0:12:02.160000 ---> 0:12:08.920000
      who viewed the body as a puzzle and who garnered a secret thrill in deriving pain.
   Segment 143
      0:12:08.920000 ---> 0:12:15
      These opponents also saw vivisection as an emblem of medical violence more broadly, seeing
   Segment 144
      0:12:15 ---> 0:12:20.120000
      a social relationship between the inhumane treatment of animals and the oppression of
   Segment 145
      0:12:20.120000 ---> 0:12:23.160000
      women and the lower classes.
   Segment 146
      0:12:23.160000 ---> 0:12:28.720000
      As Sarah Burns writes again, quote, in the minds of animal protection crusaders, there
   Segment 147
      0:12:28.720000 ---> 0:12:33.800000
      was no difference between the practice of vivisection and surgery in which women in
   Segment 148
      0:12:33.800000 ---> 0:12:40.200000
      the poor were all too often subjected to hazardous, painful, unproven procedures.
   Segment 149
      0:12:40.360000 ---> 0:12:46.120000
      Interestingly, as Burns points out, many of Aikens' critics looked at this life-saving
   Segment 150
      0:12:46.120000 ---> 0:12:51.720000
      surgery and nonetheless described it in their reviews as dissection.
   Segment 151
      0:12:51.720000 ---> 0:12:59
      Mentally-aliding actual helpful medical practices and the darker underbelly of the medical profession,
   Segment 152
      0:12:59 ---> 0:13:05.960000
      that of vivisection and grave robbing, unable to separate the two in their minds.
   Segment 153
      0:13:06.040000 ---> 0:13:12.200000
      In conclusion, Thomas Aikens, the gross clinic, is a large and controversial painting of a
   Segment 154
      0:13:12.200000 ---> 0:13:18.600000
      live surgery. Despite the fact that it depicts a fairly innovative new surgery that helped
   Segment 155
      0:13:18.600000 ---> 0:13:24.600000
      patients avoid amputation, it was nonetheless interpreted through the lens of medical horror
   Segment 156
      0:13:24.600000 ---> 0:13:32.040000
      and atrocity. Doctors of the 19th century had a long-standing dark reputation, seen as grave
   Segment 157
      0:13:32.040000 ---> 0:13:39.800000
      robbers, battle-side butchers, and vivisectors. Thomas Aikens, I think, sort of leans into this,
   Segment 158
      0:13:39.800000 ---> 0:13:45.640000
      employing ominous, tinnabristic lighting to highlight the more gruesome details of the scene,
   Segment 159
      0:13:45.640000 ---> 0:13:52.680000
      hard steel contrasting with the soft, open mystery flesh, a hand covered in deep-red blood,
   Segment 160
      0:13:52.680000 ---> 0:13:59.480000
      a woman recoiling in fright. Even today, viewers can't help but feel unsettled.

Transcription for audio6.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:04.720000
      In this video, we are discussing Thomas Aiken's The Agnew Clinic.
   Segment 2
      0:00:04.720000 ---> 0:00:09.120000
      Before we continue, I want to issue a quick content warning.
   Segment 3
      0:00:09.120000 ---> 0:00:13.920000
      This video contains discussion of medical violence against women.
   Segment 4
      0:00:13.920000 ---> 0:00:21.600000
      The Agnew Clinic from 1889 is often seen as Aiken's follow-up to the Gross Clinic.
   Segment 5
      0:00:21.600000 ---> 0:00:28.160000
      Like the Gross Clinic, we see an image of a live surgery taking place in a medical amphitheater.
   Segment 6
      0:00:28.560000 ---> 0:00:32.640000
      Though both are portraits, the earlier work was not commissioned.
   Segment 7
      0:00:32.640000 ---> 0:00:38
      However, in this case, this work was paid for by Dr. David Hayes Agnew,
   Segment 8
      0:00:38 ---> 0:00:40.960000
      a surgeon who taught for the University of Pennsylvania.
   Segment 9
      0:00:41.600000 ---> 0:00:47.040000
      This helps to explain the happier lighting and the glaring lack of blood and gore.
   Segment 10
      0:00:48.320000 ---> 0:00:55.120000
      Despite Aiken's desire for blunt accuracy, Dr. Agnew ordered that blood be entirely omitted.
   Segment 11
      0:00:55.840000 ---> 0:01:02.320000
      In the painting, we see Dr. Agnew aided by three surgical assistants and nurse Mary Climber
   Segment 12
      0:01:02.320000 ---> 0:01:08.480000
      in the partial removal of the breast of a cancer patient, while medical students look on in observation.
   Segment 13
      0:01:09.840000 ---> 0:01:14.800000
      Agnew steps back as if pausing to lecture, his right hand gesturing
   Segment 14
      0:01:14.800000 ---> 0:01:19.040000
      conversationally while his left hand still grasps a scalpel.
   Segment 15
      0:01:19.920000 ---> 0:01:25.440000
      The painting has been held up as a prime example of Aiken's scientific realism,
   Segment 16
      0:01:26 ---> 0:01:32.400000
      and as a valuable historical record in its documenting of changing surgical practices,
   Segment 17
      0:01:32.400000 ---> 0:01:37.120000
      perhaps most visibly represented by the transition to white surgical frocks.
   Segment 18
      0:01:38.480000 ---> 0:01:44.720000
      It has also, I think rightly, attracted much discussion regarding the gender politics at play.
   Segment 19
      0:01:45.520000 ---> 0:01:50.640000
      From its earliest exhibition, viewers were shocked to see a partly nude woman
   Segment 20
      0:01:50.640000 ---> 0:01:55.360000
      being observed by an auditorium full of men, save, of course, for nurse climber.
   Segment 21
      0:01:56 ---> 0:02:02.560000
      The controversy was only partly asuaged by the medical setting, and it was ultimately rejected
   Segment 22
      0:02:02.560000 ---> 0:02:08.720000
      from multiple exhibitions, finally appearing at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893.
   Segment 23
      0:02:09.520000 ---> 0:02:15.360000
      With every eye line in the room fixed on her, the patient is the center of attention,
   Segment 24
      0:02:15.360000 ---> 0:02:23.600000
      lying unconscious, vulnerable, the object of our gaze, G-A-Z-E. She's the object of Aiken's gaze, too,
   Segment 25
      0:02:24.560000 ---> 0:02:31.040000
      both in the sense that he paints the scene, but also in that he, again, includes himself in the
   Segment 26
      0:02:31.040000 ---> 0:02:35.360000
      scene, shown standing behind nurse climber on the far right of the canvas.
   Segment 27
      0:02:36.320000 ---> 0:02:42.640000
      The students look on in varying degrees of enthusiasm, some craning their necks for a better look,
   Segment 28
      0:02:42.640000 ---> 0:02:49.200000
      others nearly dozing off in boredom. With her body literally splayed before them,
   Segment 29
      0:02:49.760000 ---> 0:02:55.440000
      the patient becomes a passive specimen through which surgical knowledge is passed for one
   Segment 30
      0:02:55.440000 ---> 0:03:02.080000
      generation of male surgeons to the next, painting writ large the gendered power dynamics within this
   Segment 31
      0:03:02.240000 ---> 0:03:09.040000
      space. One curious exception to this imbalance is nurse climber, who looks on with a quiet,
   Segment 32
      0:03:09.040000 ---> 0:03:15.520000
      cool professionalism. Nurse climber graduated at the top of her class from the University of
   Segment 33
      0:03:15.520000 ---> 0:03:21.840000
      Pennsylvania's Training School for Nurses, and was the recipient of the Nightingale Award for
   Segment 34
      0:03:21.840000 ---> 0:03:27.200000
      Exceptional Patient Care and Scholarship. Though there are notable exceptions,
   Segment 35
      0:03:27.200000 ---> 0:03:33.280000
      women in late 19th century United States were largely excluded from becoming physicians,
   Segment 36
      0:03:33.280000 ---> 0:03:38.320000
      and were relegated to nursing, which was sometimes minimized as a supportive role.
   Segment 37
      0:03:39.360000 ---> 0:03:45.680000
      However, historians today largely credit the entry of female nurses into the operating room,
   Segment 38
      0:03:45.680000 ---> 0:03:53.360000
      with myriad subsequent advances in technology, sanitation, and organization. Some art historians
   Segment 39
      0:03:53.360000 ---> 0:03:59.200000
      have argued that Aiken's decision to include climber so prominently within this painting
   Segment 40
      0:03:59.200000 ---> 0:04:05.440000
      is a nod to those contributions, perhaps helping to undercut what is otherwise a highly
   Segment 41
      0:04:05.440000 ---> 0:04:12
      imbalanced gender hierarchy. And you know, that may all be well and good, but it's actually
   Segment 42
      0:04:12 ---> 0:04:18.480000
      through nurse climbers surgical notes herself that we find out that Aiken's has taken some
   Segment 43
      0:04:18.480000 ---> 0:04:24.880000
      pretty significant liberties with his representation. When preparing a patient for a mastectomy,
   Segment 44
      0:04:24.880000 ---> 0:04:29.920000
      it was the practice of the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania to cover the healthy
   Segment 45
      0:04:29.920000 ---> 0:04:37.600000
      breast, to preserve modesty, and to avoid accidental removal. Aiken's has instead chosen to leave the
   Segment 46
      0:04:37.600000 ---> 0:04:45.120000
      unaffected breast fully revealed whether the goal was to shock or titillate. Art historian Bridget
   Segment 47
      0:04:45.120000 ---> 0:04:51.760000
      Elgoode body argues in her 1994 article for the latter. The paintings quote,
   Segment 48
      0:04:51.760000 ---> 0:04:57.040000
      "...erotic elements are titillatingly foregrounded by the patient's healthy breast,
   Segment 49
      0:04:57.040000 ---> 0:05:02.480000
      whose highlighted position within the painting and whose exposure makes the patient sexually
   Segment 50
      0:05:02.480000 ---> 0:05:08.240000
      available to the eyes of the viewer." The erotics produced by the painting work to mask the
   Segment 51
      0:05:08.240000 ---> 0:05:14.400000
      violence of the mastectomy procedure and to subsequently affirm the doctor's transcendental
   Segment 52
      0:05:14.400000 ---> 0:05:21.040000
      authority. Where is the dissected breast is withheld from us, reserved for the privileged
   Segment 53
      0:05:21.040000 ---> 0:05:27.280000
      view of the surgeons? The unaffected breast is left for us, for our privileged sight.
   Segment 54
      0:05:28.240000 ---> 0:05:33.440000
      Its appearance is probably meant to force our contemplation regarding the loss of its pair.
   Segment 55
      0:05:34.080000 ---> 0:05:40.720000
      Indeed, there are certainly plenty of other existing comparative images from the time that
   Segment 56
      0:05:40.720000 ---> 0:05:47.520000
      combine this kind of medical context and sensuality, often looking to draw a distinction between
   Segment 57
      0:05:47.520000 ---> 0:05:55.120000
      idealized youth and beauty with mortality. In Anatomy of the Heart, for example, here on the right,
   Segment 58
      0:05:55.120000 ---> 0:06:02.560000
      a doctor stares thoughtfully at the literal heart that he has just pulled out of a young woman's chest
   Segment 59
      0:06:03.120000 ---> 0:06:10.400000
      as her uncovered body is left fully available to her view. Not to break the fourth wall here,
   Segment 60
      0:06:10.400000 ---> 0:06:18.080000
      but how gross is this? Bridget Goodbody takes this a few steps further. She goes on to argue in her
   Segment 61
      0:06:18.080000 ---> 0:06:23.840000
      article that to fully understand this painting, one has to also consider the social history of
   Segment 62
      0:06:23.840000 ---> 0:06:31.360000
      breast cancer. Doctors in the 19th century pathologized women's bodies and minds, arguing that reproductive
   Segment 63
      0:06:31.440000 ---> 0:06:36.320000
      organs associated with women made them weaker and more susceptible to disease.
   Segment 64
      0:06:37.600000 ---> 0:06:42.320000
      Although breast cancer was and is still routinely diagnosed in all genders,
   Segment 65
      0:06:43.360000 ---> 0:06:50.160000
      Victorian doctors regarded it strictly as a woman's disease. Some carcinoma specialists from the day
   Segment 66
      0:06:50.160000 ---> 0:06:55.840000
      were unable to mentally separate the breast from their preconceived ideas regarding sexuality.
   Segment 67
      0:06:56.640000 ---> 0:07:03.200000
      Implying that breast cancer was caused by female promiscuity. For his part, in principles and
   Segment 68
      0:07:03.200000 ---> 0:07:09.520000
      practices of surgery, Dr. Agnew himself argued that breast cancer was caused by excessive
   Segment 69
      0:07:09.520000 ---> 0:07:15.680000
      feminine nervousness and the degeneration of reproductive capability. It probably doesn't
   Segment 70
      0:07:15.680000 ---> 0:07:22.080000
      need to be said, but none of this is true. Perhaps the most damning bit of information in terms of
   Segment 71
      0:07:22.160000 ---> 0:07:28.960000
      this painting is that it was fairly well established that mastectomies of this era did not statistically
   Segment 72
      0:07:28.960000 ---> 0:07:35.360000
      elongate the lives of those suffering from breast cancer. Instead, many actually died on the table.
   Segment 73
      0:07:36.240000 ---> 0:07:41.280000
      Breast cancer during the Victorian era was only caught in its very late stages,
   Segment 74
      0:07:41.280000 ---> 0:07:46.880000
      once the disease was prominently visible on the surface. Without the additional treatments that
   Segment 75
      0:07:46.880000 ---> 0:07:53.360000
      are today available, the surgery by itself at that late of a stage frankly wasn't particularly
   Segment 76
      0:07:53.360000 ---> 0:08:01.520000
      helpful. Dr. Agnew knew this. Quote, I do not despair of carcinoma being cured somewhere in the
   Segment 77
      0:08:01.520000 ---> 0:08:08.160000
      future, but this blessed achievement will, I believe, never be wrought by the knife of a surgeon.
   Segment 78
      0:08:08.560000 ---> 0:08:16.960000
      So why was it done? Why is he doing it here? Well, it seems purely for aesthetic reasons.
   Segment 79
      0:08:18.560000 ---> 0:08:24.400000
      We would be well then to remember that not only do we have a sort of symbolic power as
   Segment 80
      0:08:24.400000 ---> 0:08:31.600000
      viewers over the passive object of our gaze, again, G-A-Z-E, but in this case, those within
   Segment 81
      0:08:31.680000 ---> 0:08:37.920000
      the auditorium also have a literal power over the patient, power over life and death,
   Segment 82
      0:08:38.640000 ---> 0:08:44.800000
      and here they are performing an unnecessary and potentially deadly surgery on an unconscious,
   Segment 83
      0:08:44.800000 ---> 0:08:52.640000
      vulnerable individual. In his book, The Birth of the Clinic from 1963, Continental philosopher
   Segment 84
      0:08:52.640000 ---> 0:09:00.080000
      Michel Foucault defined what he calls the medical gaze. In art history and related theory, we use
   Segment 85
      0:09:00.080000 ---> 0:09:06.240000
      the gaze to describe the way that looking at times relates to power. For Foucault,
   Segment 86
      0:09:06.240000 ---> 0:09:12.160000
      the medical gaze describes the mental separation of a patient's body from their actual identity,
   Segment 87
      0:09:12.160000 ---> 0:09:18.240000
      their humanity. This term feels like a useful one when looking at a painting like this,
   Segment 88
      0:09:18.960000 ---> 0:09:26.080000
      which feels objectifying in several respects, sexually and medically. In conclusion, Thomas
   Segment 89
      0:09:26.080000 ---> 0:09:31.200000
      Aiken says that Aiken's new clinic shares several basic characteristics with his earlier
   Segment 90
      0:09:31.200000 ---> 0:09:37.040000
      painting, The Gross Clinic. Much of the art historical discussion surrounding this painting
   Segment 91
      0:09:37.040000 ---> 0:09:43.040000
      has been in regard to its gender politics. While some have noted that Aiken's does feature
   Segment 92
      0:09:43.040000 ---> 0:09:48.960000
      nurse Mary Climer prominently within the scene, physically on the same level as Dr. Aikenu,
   Segment 93
      0:09:48.960000 ---> 0:09:54.320000
      and they argue that this is an acknowledgement of the important contributions ushered in by the
   Segment 94
      0:09:54.400000 ---> 0:10:00.800000
      entry of women into the operating room. Others, like art historian Bridget Goodbody,
   Segment 95
      0:10:00.800000 ---> 0:10:05.760000
      have pointed out that the patients revealed breast and the violent history behind the
   Segment 96
      0:10:05.760000 ---> 0:10:11.920000
      treatment of breast cancer during the Victorian era. Nonetheless, creates a very real power
   Segment 97
      0:10:11.920000 ---> 0:10:21.360000
      discrepancy that is difficult to overcome.
