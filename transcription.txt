Transcription for How I Code Apps SOLO That Actually Make Money (Idea + Build + Marketing Guide).mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:04.400000
      In this video, I'm going to be going over everything that you need to know to think of an app idea,
   Segment 2
      0:00:04.400000 ---> 0:00:08.240000
      build it, and sell it and market it on the internet to make your very first dollar
   Segment 3
      0:00:08.240000 ---> 0:00:12.080000
      off an app that you built. Now, in terms of why I think that you should listen to me on this topic
   Segment 4
      0:00:12.080000 ---> 0:00:16.320000
      is the fact that over the past three years, I've built probably over 14 different apps, but it
   Segment 5
      0:00:16.320000 ---> 0:00:20.800000
      wasn't until last year where I started making a few small changes to start actually making a
   Segment 6
      0:00:20.800000 ---> 0:00:24.880000
      couple hundred bucks. Now, a couple thousand bucks with my latest products, a month of recurring revenue
   Segment 7
      0:00:24.880000 ---> 0:00:28.800000
      off of the apps that I've built. And oftentimes, when I'm getting business or entrepreneur advice,
   Segment 8
      0:00:28.800000 ---> 0:00:32.800000
      I find it a lot more helpful, more actionable when there's someone that's a lot closer to me in
   Segment 9
      0:00:32.800000 ---> 0:00:36.960000
      that entrepreneurship game. And I would argue that I am much closer to you than the other people on
   Segment 10
      0:00:36.960000 ---> 0:00:41.760000
      the internet that are making 30, 50, $100,000 a month of recurring revenue. I'm not claiming to be an
   Segment 11
      0:00:41.760000 ---> 0:00:45.760000
      expert on this. I'm literally just a random guy on the internet that loves to build apps, make
   Segment 12
      0:00:45.760000 ---> 0:00:49.520000
      money off of them and market them on the internet. So I hope you find this video useful and enough of
   Segment 13
      0:00:49.520000 ---> 0:00:53.760000
      me trying to beg you to watch this video, let's just get into it. So step number one coming up with
   Segment 14
      0:00:53.760000 ---> 0:00:57.040000
      an app idea. I'm going to be very sturdy forward with this. You don't need to come up with a new
   Segment 15
      0:00:57.040000 ---> 0:01:01.280000
      idea. Just copy what already exists out there. One of the most common questions that I get asked in
   Segment 16
      0:01:01.280000 ---> 0:01:05.520000
      my YouTube comments or in my Instagram DMS is how do you go out and validate your idea? And if you
   Segment 17
      0:01:05.520000 ---> 0:01:09.680000
      watch a lot of other startup videos, particularly from channels like Y Combinator, they often tell you
   Segment 18
      0:01:09.680000 ---> 0:01:14.160000
      to go out and talk to your customers, do use your interviews, iterate quickly, see what they want,
   Segment 19
      0:01:14.160000 ---> 0:01:18.240000
      does your product really solve a problem? And that's all really good advice, especially if
   Segment 20
      0:01:18.240000 ---> 0:01:22.080000
      you're trying to build a billion dollar company that has huge room for growth. I'm going to say
   Segment 21
      0:01:22.080000 ---> 0:01:25.520000
      this, that if you are struggling to make your very first dollar on the internet, you don't need to go
   Segment 22
      0:01:25.520000 ---> 0:01:29.600000
      through all of that, because you should just go out and build out a product that already exists
   Segment 23
      0:01:29.600000 ---> 0:01:33.360000
      out there. By just building out an idea that already exists out there, the other people have
   Segment 24
      0:01:33.360000 ---> 0:01:37.360000
      already done the hard part of validating that market for you. You don't need to validate your
   Segment 25
      0:01:37.360000 ---> 0:01:40.560000
      product. You know that it's validating. And I know some of you are going to have a little bit of an
   Segment 26
      0:01:40.560000 ---> 0:01:44.880000
      ego just like I did in the beginning where you're like, but it's not original. How am I going to
   Segment 27
      0:01:44.880000 ---> 0:01:49.440000
      differentiate it from all the other products out there? No, stop. Oh, wait, stop, stop. You're done.
   Segment 28
      0:01:49.440000 ---> 0:01:53.120000
      You're done. Okay, you're done. You're so cooked right there. Drop the ego. It doesn't matter.
   Segment 29
      0:01:53.120000 ---> 0:01:57.200000
      Originality is that it does not matter, especially in the early stages. Something that I always
   Segment 30
      0:01:57.200000 ---> 0:02:01.280000
      found really funny in software businesses compared to other businesses is that whenever you say that,
   Segment 31
      0:02:01.280000 ---> 0:02:05.760000
      oh, I'm going to build XYZ app. Someone's always really quick to say that actually already exists.
   Segment 32
      0:02:05.760000 ---> 0:02:10.320000
      And then I'm like, okay, why can't there be two apps to the same existing solution? That's almost
   Segment 33
      0:02:10.320000 ---> 0:02:14
      like saying if someone wants to open up a hamburger restaurant and someone's like, actually McDonald's
   Segment 34
      0:02:14 ---> 0:02:17.600000
      already exists, you actually can't make them anymore. No, there can be multiple restaurants
   Segment 35
      0:02:17.600000 ---> 0:02:21.280000
      that provide hamburgers. Similarly, if there's one problem, there can be multiple apps that solve
   Segment 36
      0:02:21.280000 ---> 0:02:25.200000
      that problem. Sorry, tangent over. Let's get back on topic to the video. I am personally a big
   Segment 37
      0:02:25.200000 ---> 0:02:29.920000
      fan of copying an idea first and then iterating it and differentiating it later on with your own
   Segment 38
      0:02:29.920000 ---> 0:02:34.320000
      features. And in fact, my current app, which is called Monty.ai, it is an AI powered and meeting
   Segment 39
      0:02:34.320000 ---> 0:02:38.160000
      recording tool that records meetings for you and transcribes them. And I'm going to be very honest
   Segment 40
      0:02:38.160000 ---> 0:02:42.400000
      and own up to the fact that the reason why I built Monty in the first place was because I saw a lot
   Segment 41
      0:02:42.400000 ---> 0:02:46.720000
      of other AI meeting recording apps and tools out there making a ton of money. And I was like,
   Segment 42
      0:02:46.720000 ---> 0:02:50.720000
      okay, clearly, there's a big market for this. So in the beginning, I kind of just rebuilt what
   Segment 43
      0:02:50.720000 ---> 0:02:55.120000
      the other apps were already doing. And now over time, though, I slowly differentiated it by adding
   Segment 44
      0:02:55.120000 ---> 0:02:59.920000
      particularly a meeting co-pilot feature, which like listens in on meetings in real time and answers
   Segment 45
      0:02:59.920000 ---> 0:03:03.520000
      questions from those meetings based off of information that you upload. So that's a brand new feature
   Segment 46
      0:03:03.520000 ---> 0:03:08
      that the other apps don't have. But that differentiation didn't really come until I built out that base
   Segment 47
      0:03:08 ---> 0:03:11.920000
      version of the app and started making money. And the results of me just copying an idea that
   Segment 48
      0:03:11.920000 ---> 0:03:16.880000
      already exists was the fact that on launch day, I was able to scale to $1,000 a monthly recurring
   Segment 49
      0:03:16.960000 ---> 0:03:21.440000
      revenue within like one or two weeks, because the market was already validated. I knew people wanted
   Segment 50
      0:03:21.440000 ---> 0:03:25.440000
      to buy this product because the other people have already validated that market for me. I would say
   Segment 51
      0:03:25.440000 ---> 0:03:29.200000
      go out on the internet, go to like Twitter, Reddit, or even just scrolling through your TikTok
   Segment 52
      0:03:29.200000 ---> 0:03:33.680000
      Instagram or YouTube feed, you're going to see certain apps marketing towards you. And if you find
   Segment 53
      0:03:33.680000 ---> 0:03:37.200000
      those particular apps interesting, and you think that you can rebuild them yourself, just get after
   Segment 54
      0:03:37.200000 ---> 0:03:41.920000
      it and rebuild that same particular app. Number two is how to build your application. Now, I know
   Segment 55
      0:03:41.920000 ---> 0:03:45.040000
      some of you are going to have a little bit of coding experience watching this video. Some of
   Segment 56
      0:03:45.120000 ---> 0:03:48.800000
      you are going to have no coding experience watching this video. So while the experience level of the
   Segment 57
      0:03:48.800000 ---> 0:03:52.800000
      people watching this video might vary in terms of their development skills, I do think that the
   Segment 58
      0:03:52.800000 ---> 0:03:56.880000
      advice I'm going to give applies to literally anyone from all skill levels from beginner to
   Segment 59
      0:03:56.880000 ---> 0:04:01.120000
      expert. I will say in terms of building the apps out there, there's so much confusion of what's the
   Segment 60
      0:04:01.120000 ---> 0:04:05.920000
      best tech stack. Oh, well, should I do remix? Should I do spilt? Should I do next JS is next JS too much
   Segment 61
      0:04:05.920000 ---> 0:04:10.320000
      hype? Okay, there's so much noise and nuance around that topic. I really think you should just ignore
   Segment 62
      0:04:10.320000 ---> 0:04:14.400000
      all of it. My personal two cents on this topic is when you're picking your tech stack, just pick
   Segment 63
      0:04:14.400000 ---> 0:04:18.480000
      a tech stack that has the most developer support out there. You don't want to be using a tech stack
   Segment 64
      0:04:18.480000 ---> 0:04:21.920000
      that you know, not that many developers use. And then when you run into a bug, no one can really
   Segment 65
      0:04:21.920000 ---> 0:04:25.840000
      help you out. Even the LMS can't help you out because they are trained off of the data out there on
   Segment 66
      0:04:25.840000 ---> 0:04:29.600000
      the public internet. And if it's not that popular, you're going to get less developer support. So in
   Segment 67
      0:04:29.600000 ---> 0:04:34.560000
      my opinion, the most by far, the most popular tech stack out there for building web applications
   Segment 68
      0:04:34.560000 ---> 0:04:39.680000
      is next JS. Yes, is next JS perfect? No, I really don't think so. But it is one of the most popular,
   Segment 69
      0:04:39.680000 ---> 0:04:44
      if not the most popular web development framework for full stack app development. And that is what
   Segment 70
      0:04:44 ---> 0:04:47.760000
      I use to build all of my applications. So don't get lost in the weeds, don't get stuck in analysis
   Segment 71
      0:04:47.760000 ---> 0:04:51.760000
      process of trying to pick the best framework or best tech stack out there. And then to host your
   Segment 72
      0:04:51.760000 ---> 0:04:56
      next JS application, I recommend using Vercel. Once again, Vercel is not perfect. It's expensive
   Segment 73
      0:04:56 ---> 0:05:00.160000
      as hell. But it is the easiest path forward. And I really think that you should just optimize for
   Segment 74
      0:05:00.160000 ---> 0:05:04.160000
      ease of use rather than be quote unquote best solution. Right now is not the time to be a tech
   Segment 75
      0:05:04.160000 ---> 0:05:07.920000
      nerd. You can save your tech nerdiness for another time. All right. And then if you want to build a
   Segment 76
      0:05:07.920000 ---> 0:05:12.080000
      mobile application, I personally recommend using Expo, which is based off of React Native, you can
   Segment 77
      0:05:12.160000 ---> 0:05:17.200000
      build cross platform apps off of iOS and Android using one United code base. I do know some of
   Segment 78
      0:05:17.200000 ---> 0:05:20.880000
      you nerds out there are getting your pitch force being like, well, actually, capacitor JS is the
   Segment 79
      0:05:20.880000 ---> 0:05:25.360000
      better solution. Or actually, you should build two super native applications in Kotlin and Swift.
   Segment 80
      0:05:25.920000 ---> 0:05:29.920000
      Thought you're done. Get out of here. Your cook chat. I don't get them out of here. Get out. Get
   Segment 81
      0:05:29.920000 ---> 0:05:33.520000
      out of my channel right now. All right. I don't care what's the best. I just think that Expo has a
   Segment 82
      0:05:33.520000 ---> 0:05:38
      really great developer community. And oftentimes, most people just want to build an app for both
   Segment 83
      0:05:38.080000 ---> 0:05:42.400000
      Android and iOS. And I think Expo is the easiest solution to do that. But then if you're building
   Segment 84
      0:05:42.400000 ---> 0:05:47.520000
      an app just for iPhones or just for Android, then I think building with Swift or Kotlin is pretty valid
   Segment 85
      0:05:47.520000 ---> 0:05:51.360000
      as well. It's a good option. But I think Expo is more than enough. And then for your backend
   Segment 86
      0:05:51.360000 ---> 0:05:55.760000
      provider for both your mobile application or your web application, I personally recommend using
   Segment 87
      0:05:55.760000 ---> 0:06:00.160000
      Superbase as your backend provider of choice. The reason why I recommend Superbase is the fact
   Segment 88
      0:06:00.160000 ---> 0:06:04.560000
      that it has a ton of products built into one. It's almost like an all in one solution because it
   Segment 89
      0:06:04.560000 ---> 0:06:09.040000
      helps handle authentication for you, handles databases for you, and handles storage for you.
   Segment 90
      0:06:09.040000 ---> 0:06:13.120000
      Those three things right there is going to be the vast majority of your application. And it is
   Segment 91
      0:06:13.120000 ---> 0:06:17.920000
      really convenient and also very affordable just to have one platform handle all of those aspects
   Segment 92
      0:06:17.920000 ---> 0:06:21.520000
      of your application for you. But really, the biggest reason why I recommend using Superbase is the
   Segment 93
      0:06:21.520000 ---> 0:06:26.240000
      fact that it is really popular in the developer community. So there is a ton of support. A community
   Segment 94
      0:06:26.240000 ---> 0:06:30.080000
      is super active. So you're going to be able to find solutions for common bugs that you might run
   Segment 95
      0:06:30.080000 ---> 0:06:33.840000
      into. And then in terms of how to handle payment processing, I'll just go with Stripe as the most
   Segment 96
      0:06:33.840000 ---> 0:06:37.600000
      popular one. It is very straightforward to use probably has the best developer documentation,
   Segment 97
      0:06:37.600000 ---> 0:06:41.200000
      the best developer tooling out there. I really wouldn't worry too much about using other
   Segment 98
      0:06:41.200000 ---> 0:06:45.440000
      providers like paddle or lemon squeezy. I know people are like, Oh, but it's a merchant of record.
   Segment 99
      0:06:45.440000 ---> 0:06:50.080000
      You want to do good tax liability for international sale of goods. Okay, let's be honest, is that
   Segment 100
      0:06:50.080000 ---> 0:06:54.880000
      really your biggest issue is international tax compliance really the thing that is top of your
   Segment 101
      0:06:54.880000 ---> 0:06:59.040000
      mind? No, probably not. So just stick with Stripe. Trust me, it's easy. Great developer tools. All
   Segment 102
      0:06:59.040000 ---> 0:07:02.240000
      right. So just a quick recap. Number one, if you're building a full stack web application,
   Segment 103
      0:07:02.240000 ---> 0:07:05.760000
      build it using next JS and deploy it on for sale. If you're building a mobile application,
   Segment 104
      0:07:05.760000 ---> 0:07:09.600000
      build it using Expo to build on both iOS and Android at the same time, rear backend,
   Segment 105
      0:07:09.600000 ---> 0:07:13.920000
      storage authentication, use super base for payment processing, use Stripe. And then the last bonus
   Segment 106
      0:07:13.920000 ---> 0:07:18.320000
      tool that isn't necessarily required, but it's very, very helpful is post hog. Host hog is a
   Segment 107
      0:07:18.320000 ---> 0:07:22.720000
      really useful tool that lets you track events to see how your users are actually interacting
   Segment 108
      0:07:22.720000 ---> 0:07:26
      with your application. So when users click on a certain button or take a certain action,
   Segment 109
      0:07:26 ---> 0:07:29.840000
      you can track that event. So you can see our users actually using certain features of your
   Segment 110
      0:07:29.920000 ---> 0:07:33.520000
      application or not. And then it also has other really useful features like session recording,
   Segment 111
      0:07:33.520000 ---> 0:07:38
      which lets you see exactly how users are really using your application. Also, that has support
   Segment 112
      0:07:38 ---> 0:07:42
      for letting you do experiments, AB testing between different experiments or new features you're
   Segment 113
      0:07:42 ---> 0:07:46
      launching to see how improved or hurts your app. So eventually when you get to that stage where you
   Segment 114
      0:07:46 ---> 0:07:50.080000
      do want to experiment with tracking how your users are using your app or running experiments,
   Segment 115
      0:07:50.080000 ---> 0:07:54.080000
      I really think you should use post hog Azure default for that. Last but not least, how to market
   Segment 116
      0:07:54.080000 ---> 0:07:57.760000
      and sell your product. All right. So this is where most developers get tripped up because a lot of
   Segment 117
      0:07:57.920000 ---> 0:08:02.800000
      developers can build the product. They don't know how to market and sell it. There's literally an
   Segment 118
      0:08:02.800000 ---> 0:08:06.480000
      infinite number of possibilities of ways to market your application. And I definitely won't be able
   Segment 119
      0:08:06.480000 ---> 0:08:10.240000
      to go over every single one of them out there, but I'll go over some of the most popular ones. So
   Segment 120
      0:08:10.240000 ---> 0:08:14.560000
      first off, I want to talk about social media and marketing, particularly organic social media
   Segment 121
      0:08:14.560000 ---> 0:08:17.680000
      marketing. Kind of like how I said in the first section of this video in terms of how to come up
   Segment 122
      0:08:17.680000 ---> 0:08:21.920000
      with an idea for your application, I said kind of scroll through media, see what apps are being
   Segment 123
      0:08:21.920000 ---> 0:08:25.360000
      advertised to you and just rebuilding those out. Similarly, if you want to go out and make social
   Segment 124
      0:08:25.360000 ---> 0:08:30.080000
      media content to market your app, I really recommend going through social media, finding other accounts,
   Segment 125
      0:08:30.080000 ---> 0:08:34.560000
      other app accounts that are marketing their app and literally just copy their format. Chances are,
   Segment 126
      0:08:34.560000 ---> 0:08:38.720000
      if the format works for them, it's also going to work for you. It's a viral format. Be shameless
   Segment 127
      0:08:38.720000 ---> 0:08:42.560000
      about it. Don't have an ego about originality. That doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter.
   Segment 128
      0:08:42.560000 ---> 0:08:47.040000
      Once again, do not care about the ego. Put the ego away. You don't need to be original. Just copy
   Segment 129
      0:08:47.040000 ---> 0:08:51.600000
      the content that works for other software app accounts and literally remake them, repurpose them,
   Segment 130
      0:08:51.680000 ---> 0:08:56
      and do the same format for your app. Another nice form of social media marketing is Reddit
   Segment 131
      0:08:56 ---> 0:09:00.240000
      advertising. This one is really interesting where you kind of just lurk around Reddit to see where
   Segment 132
      0:09:00.240000 ---> 0:09:05.520000
      are people hosting about their problems. And then you can just go in and then add type in your
   Segment 133
      0:09:05.520000 ---> 0:09:09.520000
      product or the app that you built as a potential solution to that problem. When it works well,
   Segment 134
      0:09:09.520000 ---> 0:09:14.160000
      it works really, really well. But at the same time, Reddit is usually pretty strict about moderating
   Segment 135
      0:09:14.160000 ---> 0:09:18.640000
      these communities or the community mods are really strict about making sure like self-promotions
   Segment 136
      0:09:18.640000 ---> 0:09:22.160000
      are not allowed. So they might delete your comments and you might get banned from certain
   Segment 137
      0:09:22.160000 ---> 0:09:25.840000
      subreddits. Tell me how I know. Yes, I've been banned from certain subreddits for trying to market it
   Segment 138
      0:09:25.840000 ---> 0:09:29.600000
      then in the past. But it is still a very valid solution. And I know a lot of people that do it
   Segment 139
      0:09:29.600000 ---> 0:09:33.360000
      very, very well. There's actually certain tools that exist out there that actually help you monitor
   Segment 140
      0:09:33.360000 ---> 0:09:36.880000
      Reddit for certain keywords. That's that if you are looking for a certain keyword for your
   Segment 141
      0:09:36.880000 ---> 0:09:40.560000
      application that you want to market on, they will then send you every single post that pertains
   Segment 142
      0:09:40.560000 ---> 0:09:44.640000
      to that particular keyword. And then you can go in, comment your solution, try to help out there.
   Segment 143
      0:09:44.640000 ---> 0:09:48.240000
      It's really useful. Now with Reddit, I personally haven't had a lot of success with it, but I know
   Segment 144
      0:09:48.240000 ---> 0:09:52.320000
      a lot of my other founder friends have had a ton of success with Reddit. So your mileage may vary.
   Segment 145
      0:09:52.320000 ---> 0:09:56.480000
      I am personally much more skilled in the social media aspect of things like making videos on TikTok
   Segment 146
      0:09:56.480000 ---> 0:10:00.880000
      and Instagram. But I will say Reddit is really nice because it has a much lower barrier of entry.
   Segment 147
      0:10:00.880000 ---> 0:10:04.400000
      It's literally just a text post where as with TikTok and Instagram and social media marketing,
   Segment 148
      0:10:04.400000 ---> 0:10:08.560000
      it requires video editing, video production, which can get a little bit harder compared to just
   Segment 149
      0:10:08.560000 ---> 0:10:12.560000
      writing a post on Reddit. And the great part about Reddit marketing is the fact that it still has
   Segment 150
      0:10:12.560000 ---> 0:10:16.480000
      very big viral potential if one of your posts goes viral on Reddit. And at the same time,
   Segment 151
      0:10:16.480000 ---> 0:10:20.320000
      you can comment on a lot of other posts that already exist out there that aren't necessarily
   Segment 152
      0:10:20.320000 ---> 0:10:24.720000
      viral. But because Google and other search engines love Reddit so much, oftentimes what's going to
   Segment 153
      0:10:24.720000 ---> 0:10:28.960000
      happen is you can find certain threads on Reddit being recommended on Google for a particular
   Segment 154
      0:10:28.960000 ---> 0:10:33.200000
      problem, asking for a solution to a particular problem. And as long as your comment exists in
   Segment 155
      0:10:33.200000 ---> 0:10:36.320000
      there, there's going to be a chance that someone goes to that Reddit post, sees your comment with
   Segment 156
      0:10:36.320000 ---> 0:10:39.440000
      the link to your product. And then they're going to visit your website from that Reddit post. So
   Segment 157
      0:10:39.440000 ---> 0:10:44.560000
      Reddit is super, super powerful. I highly recommend doing something where you leave a lot of comment
   Segment 158
      0:10:44.640000 ---> 0:10:49.120000
      on a lot of posts promoting your tool, plugging your tool such that sure, people that are on Reddit
   Segment 159
      0:10:49.120000 ---> 0:10:53.280000
      will negatively find it there. But even more importantly, people that go search that problem
   Segment 160
      0:10:53.280000 ---> 0:10:57.680000
      from Google and end up on the website can then see that solution as well from your comment. And
   Segment 161
      0:10:57.680000 ---> 0:11:01.760000
      on this topic of Google loving Reddit and recommending them in the search results is a good transition
   Segment 162
      0:11:01.760000 ---> 0:11:06.160000
      into the marketing topic of search engine optimization. Search engine optimization is basically figuring
   Segment 163
      0:11:06.160000 ---> 0:11:11.040000
      out ways maybe writing blog posts or doing guest blog posts or commenting on Reddit posts to make
   Segment 164
      0:11:11.120000 ---> 0:11:15.520000
      sure that your app comes up on Google and other search engine results. Now, I'm not the biggest
   Segment 165
      0:11:15.520000 ---> 0:11:19.040000
      expert on this field and I'll probably make a completely separate video talking about this.
   Segment 166
      0:11:19.040000 ---> 0:11:23.360000
      But search engine optimization is a great marketing solution. Just the only downside is the fact that
   Segment 167
      0:11:23.360000 ---> 0:11:28.160000
      it has a lot less viral potential compared to Reddit marketing or TikTok and Instagram marketing.
   Segment 168
      0:11:28.160000 ---> 0:11:31.360000
      And it's definitely a much longer term investment that can be super useful for you,
   Segment 169
      0:11:31.360000 ---> 0:11:34.640000
      but you're not going to get as many short term rewards in the future. Now, kind of going back to
   Segment 170
      0:11:34.640000 ---> 0:11:38.480000
      social media, another great example of social media marketing is influencer marketing,
   Segment 171
      0:11:38.480000 ---> 0:11:43.040000
      basically just doing brand deals with influencers. Now, be careful with this is very, very expensive
   Segment 172
      0:11:43.040000 ---> 0:11:46.880000
      because some influencers can ask for a ton of money and it's going to take a lot of time to find
   Segment 173
      0:11:46.880000 ---> 0:11:50.800000
      the influencers and negotiate back and forth with these creators. But I will say when you
   Segment 174
      0:11:50.800000 ---> 0:11:55.520000
      find the right influencer, it can really take your product from zero to 100 really, really fast,
   Segment 175
      0:11:55.520000 ---> 0:11:59.680000
      but it's also really difficult doing these brand partnerships and these influencer brand deals
   Segment 176
      0:11:59.680000 ---> 0:12:04.400000
      because it's really hard often to find the right creator product fit for your product. But it is a
   Segment 177
      0:12:04.480000 ---> 0:12:08.880000
      very valid marketing solution. And if it works well, you can go from zero to 100 super quick.
   Segment 178
      0:12:08.880000 ---> 0:12:12.560000
      And oftentimes you'll be able to see results instantly the minute the creators make a video
   Segment 179
      0:12:12.560000 ---> 0:12:17.040000
      that advertise your product. Once again, there's no one solution fits all for all types of products
   Segment 180
      0:12:17.040000 ---> 0:12:21.280000
      out there. But I will say if I had to choose just one or two marketing tactics to advertise
   Segment 181
      0:12:21.280000 ---> 0:12:25.680000
      certain software products on the internet, I would really index super heavily on short form video on
   Segment 182
      0:12:25.680000 ---> 0:12:29.680000
      TikTok and Instagram to market your product as well as Reddit. I personally think that those two
   Segment 183
      0:12:29.680000 ---> 0:12:33.280000
      marketing strategies are going to be the ones that provide you the most return on investment in
   Segment 184
      0:12:33.280000 ---> 0:12:37.440000
      terms of time put into it. It's going to be instant quick results oftentimes because you'll be able to
   Segment 185
      0:12:37.440000 ---> 0:12:41.920000
      get a super quick signal to see is your post going viral or not. And you can then validate your idea
   Segment 186
      0:12:41.920000 ---> 0:12:46.160000
      super quickly and hopefully get your very first customer and your very first transaction. I'll
   Segment 187
      0:12:46.160000 ---> 0:12:50.160000
      probably make another video in the future where I go super in depth into the various SaaS marketing
   Segment 188
      0:12:50.160000 ---> 0:12:53.760000
      tactics. But that'll be a video for another time because this video is already super long.
   Segment 189
      0:12:53.760000 ---> 0:12:58.560000
      Anyways, that is my video on a complete A to Z guide on how to come up with an app idea,
   Segment 190
      0:12:58.560000 ---> 0:13:02.960000
      build it and market it on the internet to hopefully help you make your very first dollar
   Segment 191
      0:13:02.960000 ---> 0:13:06.320000
      with your very first app that you develop. Let me know if you have any questions or comments,
   Segment 192
      0:13:06.320000 ---> 0:13:10.480000
      leave them down below. I will try my best to answer every single one that I can, but that is it for
   Segment 193
      0:13:10.480000 ---> 0:13:13.280000
      today's video and I will see you in the next one. Peace.

      it, market it and sell it online so you can finally make your first dollar.
   Segment 3
      0:00:10.040000 ---> 0:00:11.640000
      Look, why you should listen to me?
   Segment 4
      0:00:11.640000 ---> 0:00:17.200000
      I've been in the app game for 10 years now and this past year I helped my clients launch
   Segment 5
      0:00:17.200000 ---> 0:00:20.360000
      56 apps and they're making millions.
   Segment 6
      0:00:20.360000 ---> 0:00:23.360000
      I saw that and got jealous.
   Segment 7
      0:00:23.360000 ---> 0:00:29.880000
      So late last year I took my framework and launched three microsas products that already
   Segment 8
      0:00:29.880000 ---> 0:00:32
      pulled in over 15k.
   Segment 9
      0:00:32 ---> 0:00:38.520000
      I know personally how tough it's to earn that first hundred or even that first thousand
   Segment 10
      0:00:38.520000 ---> 0:00:39.520000
      bucks.
   Segment 11
      0:00:39.520000 ---> 0:00:41
      I'm on your level.
   Segment 12
      0:00:41 ---> 0:00:48.120000
      I'm not one of these billionaire gurus giving you that bullshit advice like discipline.
   Segment 13
      0:00:48.120000 ---> 0:00:49.360000
      So let's cut the crap.
   Segment 14
      0:00:49.360000 ---> 0:00:53.440000
      When it comes to finding your app idea you don't need to reinwind the wheel.
   Segment 15
      0:00:53.440000 ---> 0:00:54.440000
      Seriously.
   Segment 16
      0:00:54.440000 ---> 0:00:57.840000
      You can just copy what's already working out there.
   Segment 17
      0:00:57.840000 ---> 0:01:02.800000
      One of the hottest questions in my YouTube and ex-damps is how do I find and validate
   Segment 18
      0:01:02.800000 ---> 0:01:03.800000
      my idea.
   Segment 19
      0:01:03.800000 ---> 0:01:06.200000
      Sweetie, you do not need a new idea.
   Segment 20
      0:01:06.200000 ---> 0:01:10.160000
      I hate these startup accelerators like Y Combinator.
   Segment 21
      0:01:10.160000 ---> 0:01:11.960000
      Been there, done that.

      Find their problems.

      0:01:22.840000 ---> 0:01:24.080000
      Yeah, thanks.
   Segment 28
      0:01:24.080000 ---> 0:01:25.080000
      I'm done.
   Segment 29
      0:01:25.080000 ---> 0:01:31.160000
      People are looking for new slaves that will work 24-7 with their accelerators and their
   Segment 30
      0:01:31.160000 ---> 0:01:37.800000
      investments to have a 3% chance to become an average business and less than 1% to become
   Segment 31
      0:01:37.800000 ---> 0:01:38.800000
      a unicorn.
   Segment 32
      0:01:38.800000 ---> 0:01:43.600000
      So if you're still struggling to make your very first dollar online you don't need to
   Segment 33
      0:01:43.600000 ---> 0:01:46.800000

      Just build a product that's already out there.
   Segment 35
      0:01:49.480000 ---> 0:01:50.480000
      Why?
   Segment 36
      0:01:50.480000 ---> 0:01:55.280000
      Because someone else already did the heavy lifting of proving the market exists for
   Segment 37
      0:01:55.280000 ---> 0:01:56.480000
      that idea.
   Segment 38
      0:01:56.480000 ---> 0:01:58.840000
      You don't have to validate it again.
   Segment 39
      0:01:58.840000 ---> 0:02:00.840000
      You already know it works.
   Segment 40

      Now, I know some of you might have that little voice in your head screaming.

      How dare you.
   Segment 42
      0:02:07.600000 ---> 0:02:09.200000
      That's not original.
   Segment 43
      0:02:09.200000 ---> 0:02:13.600000
      How will I stand out from all other copycats?
   Segment 44
      0:02:13.600000 ---> 0:02:15.480000
      Just shut that down.
   Segment 45
      0:02:15.480000 ---> 0:02:16.480000
      Originality is dead.
   Segment 46
      0:02:16.480000 ---> 0:02:19.040000
      Especially when you're just starting out.
   Segment 47
      0:02:19.040000 ---> 0:02:21.280000
      It's not about reinventing the wheel.
   Segment 48
      0:02:21.280000 ---> 0:02:26.480000
      It's about getting your foot in the door and making that first box.
   Segment 49
      0:02:26.480000 ---> 0:02:28.680000
      So stop overthinking it.
   Segment 50
      0:02:28.680000 ---> 0:02:29.680000
      Just copy.
   Segment 51

      One more thing.

      How many Tiker shops do you think can survive in one big city?
   Segment 60
      0:02:44.040000 ---> 0:02:45.040000
      Look.
   Segment 61
      0:02:45.040000 ---> 0:02:46.040000
      Competition is normal.
   Segment 62
      0:02:46.040000 ---> 0:02:48.480000
      And being a clone is totally fine.
   Segment 63
      0:02:48.480000 ---> 0:02:54.720000
      I built my micros as a clone, but I added just one feature with my next G.S. starter

      That's it.
   Segment 67
      0:03:02.040000 ---> 0:03:03.040000
      Nothing fancy.
   Segment 68
      0:03:03.040000 ---> 0:03:09.720000
      Only now four months later, after the release and after earning 15k, I truly understand the
   Segment 69
      0:03:09.720000 ---> 0:03:14.960000
      pain points of my customers and the new features they really need.
   Segment 70
      0:03:14.960000 ---> 0:03:19.720000
      So stop whining about being 100% original.
   Segment 71
      0:03:19.720000 ---> 0:03:23.720000
      Focus on getting your product out there and learning on the go.
   Segment 72
      0:03:23.720000 ---> 0:03:27.200000
      By the way, you know what kills 99% of startups?
   Segment 73
      0:03:27.200000 ---> 0:03:28.200000
      Wrong ambitions.
   Segment 74

   Segment 76
      0:03:35.520000 ---> 0:03:37.600000
      But that's not how it works.
   Segment 77
      0:03:37.600000 ---> 0:03:42.240000
      To earn your first million, you need to start with a mini startup clone.
   Segment 78
      0:03:42.240000 ---> 0:03:47.920000
      Make a profit of $10,000, get acquired and sell it for $30,000.
   Segment 79
      0:03:47.920000 ---> 0:03:55.760000
      Then build a second clone, earn $100,000 and get acquired and sell it for $300,000.
   Segment 80
      0:03:55.760000 ---> 0:03:56.760000
      And repeat.
   Segment 81
      0:03:56.760000 ---> 0:04:02.400000
      After your second or third mini startup sale, you will have the experience, the know-how
   Segment 82
      0:04:02.400000 ---> 0:04:06.480000
      and most importantly, the cash to launch your E.I.

      disruptor like Peter levels.

      After startups, it's Uber, booking.com or Peter levels photo AI.
   Segment 85
      0:04:13.720000 ---> 0:04:17.160000
      So it starts up that destroy old markets.
   Segment 86
      0:04:17.160000 ---> 0:04:18.760000
      But here's the real kicker.
   Segment 87
      0:04:18.760000 ---> 0:04:25.440000
      If you try to build a business around your so-called unique idea right now, you either
   Segment 88
      0:04:25.440000 ---> 0:04:32.160000
      need one million in funding from the get-go or you need 7 plus years of experience with

      70 plus startups under your belt like Peter.

      Which one do you have right now?
   Segment 91
      0:04:38.320000 ---> 0:04:39.320000
      Never.
   Segment 92
      0:04:39.320000 ---> 0:04:41.840000
      Never put all your eggs in one basket.
   Segment 93
      0:04:41.840000 ---> 0:04:46.800000
      In this startup world, your ventures are your bitches and you are the pimp.
   Segment 94
      0:04:46.800000 ---> 0:04:49.960000
      Once again, stop thinking big.
   Segment 95
      0:04:49.960000 ---> 0:04:54.760000
      Because I remember seven years ago, I was dreaming about startups that would bring me
   Segment 96
      0:04:54.760000 ---> 0:04:57.480000
      10, maybe even $100 million.
   Segment 97
      0:04:57.480000 ---> 0:05:01.560000
      I gathered what I thought was the dream team.
   Segment 98
      0:05:01.560000 ---> 0:05:08.320000
      As an awesome co-founder, raised 8K in investment and invest 100K of my own cash.
   Segment 99
      0:05:08.320000 ---> 0:05:14.480000
      We were building this massive video streaming platform that was supposed to revolutionize

      the DJI drone market.
   Segment 101
      0:05:16.480000 ---> 0:05:22.760000
      Long story short, two years later, we had one user who paid $800 and our company went

      0:05:22.760000 ---> 0:05:23.920000
      bankrupt.
   Segment 103

      the best products of the month and year.

   Segment 114
      0:06:02.440000 ---> 0:06:04.880000
      But building them seems overwhelming, right?

      That's why I share no code hacks to launch solo without money.

      Now I know some of you have a bit of coding experience while others might be completely

      new.
   Segment 122
      0:06:26.760000 ---> 0:06:31.840000
      But trust me, the advice I'm about to drop lights to everyone from beginners to experts.
   Segment 123

      Step 0.

      Developers, you'll get it.
   Segment 125
      0:06:35 ---> 0:06:41.880000
      Before you dive into building your full product, start with a simple landing page using AI
   Segment 126
      0:06:41.880000 ---> 0:06:45.080000
      tools like Coursera, both new or win survey.
   Segment 127
      0:06:45.080000 ---> 0:06:46.640000
      I test the waters.
   Segment 128
      0:06:46.640000 ---> 0:06:51.800000
      See if people are even willing to pay for your idea if you start making sales.
   Segment 129
      0:06:51.800000 ---> 0:06:53.280000
      That's your green light.
   Segment 130
      0:06:53.280000 ---> 0:06:57.600000
      Peter Levels sold his book before he wrote a single word.

   Segment 132
      0:07:00.200000 ---> 0:07:02.600000
      Here's a harsh truth.
   Segment 133
      0:07:02.600000 ---> 0:07:07.600000
      Your biggest mistake right now is obsessing over the technology instead of focusing on
   Segment 134
      0:07:07.600000 ---> 0:07:10.680000
      speed and capitalizing on what's trending.

   Segment 139
      0:07:22.800000 ---> 0:07:24.760000
      You basically have two parts.
   Segment 140
      0:07:24.760000 ---> 0:07:29.880000
      Use no code tools like make or N8N to build your workflow and wrap it up.
   Segment 141
      0:07:29.880000 ---> 0:07:34.840000
      Or if you're a developer, write the code yourself and plug it into your wrapper.
   Segment 142
      0:07:34.840000 ---> 0:07:37.240000
      But here's a reality check.
   Segment 143
      0:07:37.240000 ---> 0:07:40.240000
      Most people get full focus on the wrapper.

      Sure, there's endless options out there.

   Segment 147
      0:07:53.520000 ---> 0:07:54.840000
      And here's a secret.
   Segment 148
      0:07:54.840000 ---> 0:08:04.720000
      In 90% cases you build your cash cow once then milk it until it runs dry without touching

      accountants to sort out the tax headaches.
   Segment 189
      0:09:58.480000 ---> 0:10:03.520000
      If Stripe isn't available in your own country, no sweet, you can quickly set up a company

      0:10:03.520000 ---> 0:10:10.680000

      Now let's talk analytics post-hog.
   Segment 212
      0:11:19.440000 ---> 0:11:25.400000
      It integrates super easily with your next GS project and its killer feature session replay.
   Segment 213

   Segment 215
      0:11:33.480000 ---> 0:11:37.440000
      Plus, post-hog gives you tons of free events.
   Segment 216
      0:11:37.440000 ---> 0:11:40.400000
      So you're not immediately locked into a paid plan.
   Segment 217

      And for online chat, there's CRISP.
   Segment 221
      0:11:59.680000 ---> 0:12:01.600000
      CRISP is sleek and modern.
   Segment 222
      0:12:01.600000 ---> 0:12:07.760000
      It gives your landing page your useful edge and can boost conversion rates on call traffic

      But that's not the worst part.
   Segment 230
      0:12:32.520000 ---> 0:12:37.880000
      Instead of building actual product, you waste months setting up stripe payments, designing

      That's why most people give up.

      But I've been through this pain 15 times.
   Segment 236
      0:12:56.920000 ---> 0:13:02.720000
      I spent hundreds of hours on these repetitive tasks, but I knew there had to be a better

      way.
   Segment 238
      0:13:03.720000 ---> 0:13:09.520000
      So I built the microsasfast starter kit, a complete SAS starter kit that helped me launch three

   Segment 242
      0:13:18.080000 ---> 0:13:23.960000
      You don't need to waste months building basic features that are already done.
   Segment 243
      0:13:23.960000 ---> 0:13:29.880000
      And you don't need to spend weeks overthinking about minimum feature set for a quick launch,

      This is where most developers get stuck.
   Segment 251
      0:13:52.280000 ---> 0:13:57.640000
      Building your product is one thing, but selling it, that's a whole different ball game.
   Segment 252
      0:13:57.640000 ---> 0:14:02.080000
      There are endless marketing strategies out there, but I'm going to focus on the ones

   Segment 258
      0:14:11.680000 ---> 0:14:19.320000

      look at your product.

      That's what sells your product.

      The takeaway?

      Your competitors aren't your friends.

      0:16:03.680000 ---> 0:16:07.840000
      My account could bend more times than I can count.
   Segment 290
      0:16:07.840000 ---> 0:16:10
      And my posts were frequently deleted.
   Segment 291
      0:16:10 ---> 0:16:16.280000
      But even so, I still managed to land leads who paid and even used my services for free.
   Segment 292
      0:16:16.280000 ---> 0:16:20.680000
      The truth is I never quite sid-cracked the code on Reddit.
   Segment 293
      0:16:20.680000 ---> 0:16:28.360000
      Most of my clients rely on competitors' analysis and tools like F5Bot to see how faults in
   Segment 294
      0:16:28.360000 ---> 0:16:33.520000
      other niches push their products with helpful posts.
   Segment 295
      0:16:33.520000 ---> 0:16:37.480000
      Sometimes you might even need to buy upvotes.
   Segment 296
      0:16:37.480000 ---> 0:16:39
      Surprise, surprise.
   Segment 297
      0:16:39 ---> 0:16:41.040000
      There is no magic formula here.
   Segment 298
      0:16:41.040000 ---> 0:16:43.800000
      Just watch what successful competitors are doing.
   Segment 299
      0:16:43.800000 ---> 0:16:47.600000
      Or if you're feeling cheeky, bribe a moderator.
   Segment 300
      0:16:47.600000 ---> 0:16:51.320000
      Remember why we are cloning products in the first place?
   Segment 301
      0:16:51.320000 ---> 0:16:56.520000
      There is always someone dissatisfied with the current solution.
   Segment 302
      0:16:56.520000 ---> 0:17:00.720000
      Always on the hunt for a better alternative.
   Segment 303
      0:17:00.720000 ---> 0:17:03.480000
      That's where Google Ads comes in.
   Segment 304
      0:17:03.480000 ---> 0:17:06.320000
      Simply gather the names of your competitors.
   Segment 305
      0:17:06.320000 ---> 0:17:10.480000
      Target keywords like Google Analytics Alternatives.
   Segment 306
      0:17:10.480000 ---> 0:17:13.360000
      And set up a basic landing page.
   Segment 307
      0:17:13.360000 ---> 0:17:17.480000
      People searching for alternatives are super aware.
   Segment 308
      0:17:17.480000 ---> 0:17:19.600000
      They're particularly ready to buy.
   Segment 309
      0:17:19.600000 ---> 0:17:24.960000
      And trust me, Google Ads can be a lot more affordable than you might think.
   Segment 310
      0:17:24.960000 ---> 0:17:32
      If you're planning to become the next big influencer on TikTok or X, forget it.
   Segment 311
      0:17:32 ---> 0:17:37.800000
      Content marketing on these platforms is a long, expensive slog with no guaranteed pay
   Segment 312
      0:17:37.800000 ---> 0:17:38.800000
      off.
   Segment 313
      0:17:38.800000 ---> 0:17:43.600000
      TikTok is swarming with silly, mindless videos.
   Segment 314
      0:17:43.600000 ---> 0:17:46.160000
      Your product won't get attention.
   Segment 315
      0:17:46.160000 ---> 0:17:47.560000
      It deserves there.
   Segment 316
      0:17:47.560000 ---> 0:17:50.840000
      X might work as a side channel.
   Segment 317
      0:17:50.840000 ---> 0:17:54.080000
      But it can't be your main lead generation.
   Segment 318
      0:17:54.080000 ---> 0:18:01.800000
      Unless you are called the aiming and dishing out free value upfront, which might work for
   Segment 319
      0:18:01.800000 ---> 0:18:06.280000
      validating your idea and landing your first 10 users.
   Segment 320
      0:18:06.280000 ---> 0:18:11.760000
      Again, just copy what successful people in your niche are doing and adopt it to your
   Segment 321
      0:18:11.760000 ---> 0:18:12.760000
      own style.
   Segment 322
      0:18:12.760000 ---> 0:18:17
      Speaking of dishing out value, let me share a quick story.
   Segment 323
      0:18:17 ---> 0:18:22.160000
      A client once came to me needing a $200 Angular landing page.
   Segment 324
      0:18:22.160000 ---> 0:18:24.880000
      My team and I spent four weeks on it.
   Segment 325
      0:18:24.880000 ---> 0:18:27.560000
      And the product cost me about $2,000.
   Segment 326
      0:18:27.560000 ---> 0:18:34.600000
      My dev salary plus my team linked to involvement plus many issues with Angular 1 back in the
   Segment 327
      0:18:34.600000 ---> 0:18:35.600000
      days.
   Segment 328
      0:18:35.600000 ---> 0:18:42.080000
      So I get a tiny $200 profit and at least $1,800, really.
   Segment 329
      0:18:42.080000 ---> 0:18:50
      Just one month later, that same client returned to the $500,000 contract.
   Segment 330
      0:18:50 ---> 0:18:53.960000
      The lesson always overdeliver, especially at the beginning.
   Segment 331
      0:18:53.960000 ---> 0:18:59.840000
      Next up, hunt down influencers in your niche on YouTube, Instagram and even TikTok.
   Segment 332
      0:18:59.840000 ---> 0:19:05.960000
      Pitch them to promote your product, whether that's through a paid deal, an affiliate program
   Segment 333
      0:19:05.960000 ---> 0:19:09.040000
      or even by offering lifetime free access.
   Segment 334
      0:19:09.040000 ---> 0:19:11.640000
      Someone will turn you down and someone will buy it.
   Segment 335
      0:19:11.640000 ---> 0:19:16.560000
      You can also arrange cross promotions where they market your product to their audience
   Segment 336
      0:19:16.560000 ---> 0:19:20.360000
      and you return the favor via your email list.
   Segment 337
      0:19:20.360000 ---> 0:19:25.480000
      Speaking of which, if you've got a killer product and a solid client base, hit me up.
   Segment 338
      0:19:25.480000 ---> 0:19:27.800000
      I'm all about cross promotions.
   Segment 339
      0:19:27.800000 ---> 0:19:30.200000
      Finally, start your own YouTube channel.
   Segment 340
      0:19:30.200000 ---> 0:19:36.040000
      It might sound intimidating, but it's way simpler than you think.
   Segment 341
      0:19:36.040000 ---> 0:19:37.360000
      Here's a formula.
   Segment 342
      0:19:37.360000 ---> 0:19:41.280000
      Find a key word that resonates with your audience.
   Segment 343
      0:19:41.280000 ---> 0:19:45.480000
      Identify related topics that need coverage.
   Segment 344
      0:19:45.480000 ---> 0:19:50.400000
      Just down some bullet points invest in a decent microphone.
   Segment 345
      0:19:50.400000 ---> 0:19:52.960000
      Sound quality is the key.
   Segment 346
      0:19:52.960000 ---> 0:19:57.560000
      And then fire up your phone, camera and screen recorder.
   Segment 347
      0:19:57.560000 ---> 0:20:00.880000
      Record your insights, then edit the mistakes.
   Segment 348
      0:20:00.880000 ---> 0:20:05.160000
      The first video is always hardest, but with each one, it gets easier.
   Segment 349
      0:20:05.160000 ---> 0:20:08.280000
      Plus, YouTube works like magic.
   Segment 350
      0:20:08.280000 ---> 0:20:11.840000
      Well, it's essentially SEO on steroids.
   Segment 351
      0:20:11.840000 ---> 0:20:18.200000
      It also hooks people on your personality, turning casual viewers into loyal customers.
   Segment 352
      0:20:18.200000 ---> 0:20:23
      Look at Jason, a guy who starts at a YouTube channel while being a project manager.
   Segment 353
      0:20:23 ---> 0:20:27.320000
      He didn't stress about camera sound script and all that stuff.
   Segment 354
      0:20:27.320000 ---> 0:20:30.680000
      He just started to comment his journey into the E.I.

      world and the cool stuff he found there.
   Segment 356

      around 14k an autopilot.

Transcription for How To Program Apps That Make INFINITE MONEY.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:01.080000
      So you want to get rich, huh?
   Segment 2
      0:00:01.080000 ---> 0:00:03.040000
      That bank account is looking a bit empty, isn't it?
   Segment 3
      0:00:03.040000 ---> 0:00:05.320000
      Let's fix that with a little program you magic.
   Segment 4
      0:00:05.320000 ---> 0:00:07.760000
      All you have to do is go to your bank account, right click,
   Segment 5
      0:00:07.760000 ---> 0:00:10.520000
      select Inspect Element, and change the amount of money you have,
   Segment 6
      0:00:10.520000 ---> 0:00:13.480000
      and there you go, ladies and gentlemen, we're officially rich.
   Segment 7
      0:00:13.480000 ---> 0:00:14.320000
      It's that easy.
   Segment 8
      0:00:14.320000 ---> 0:00:16.280000
      I'll see you all in the next video.
   Segment 9
      0:00:16.280000 ---> 0:00:17.520000
      All right, all right, enough jokes.
   Segment 10
      0:00:17.520000 ---> 0:00:19.080000
      You want to get rich from programming,
   Segment 11
      0:00:19.080000 ---> 0:00:20.720000
      which means you're different from other people.
   Segment 12
      0:00:20.720000 ---> 0:00:22
      You don't want a regular job.
   Segment 13
      0:00:22 ---> 0:00:22.920000
      You're a hustler.
   Segment 14
      0:00:22.920000 ---> 0:00:25.120000
      You want to break the system, escape the matrix.
   Segment 15
      0:00:25.120000 ---> 0:00:26.240000
      Well, don't worry, buddy.
   Segment 16
      0:00:26.240000 ---> 0:00:27.440000
      In this video, I'm going to show you
   Segment 17
      0:00:27.440000 ---> 0:00:29.880000
      how to program apps that actually make money.
   Segment 18
      0:00:29.880000 ---> 0:00:31.360000
      I'm going to guide you through the process of how
   Segment 19
      0:00:31.360000 ---> 0:00:33.720000
      to get an idea, how to code it, and how to market it.
   Segment 20
      0:00:33.720000 ---> 0:00:35.520000
      Trust me, I'm an expert at this.
   Segment 21
      0:00:35.520000 ---> 0:00:38.200000
      Disclaimer, this person is an unemployed loser.
   Segment 22
      0:00:38.200000 ---> 0:00:40.200000
      He has no experience whatsoever.
   Segment 23
      0:00:40.200000 ---> 0:00:42.520000
      Viewer discretion is advised.
   Segment 24
      0:00:42.520000 ---> 0:00:43.320000
      That was weird.
   Segment 25
      0:00:43.320000 ---> 0:00:44.120000
      So the app idea.
   Segment 26
      0:00:44.120000 ---> 0:00:45.160000
      Let's get one thing straight.
   Segment 27
      0:00:45.160000 ---> 0:00:47.200000
      Our goal here is to get rich, not build
   Segment 28
      0:00:47.200000 ---> 0:00:48.520000
      the next billion dollar company.
   Segment 29
      0:00:48.520000 ---> 0:00:51.680000
      All we need to do is create a project that pays your rent
   Segment 30
      0:00:51.680000 ---> 0:00:53.240000
      and your random door dash orders.
   Segment 31
      0:00:53.240000 ---> 0:00:55.040000
      This makes our job 10 times easier,
   Segment 32
      0:00:55.040000 ---> 0:00:57.200000
      because now we don't have to build some project that'll
   Segment 33
      0:00:57.200000 ---> 0:00:58.640000
      solve a problem for humanity.
   Segment 34
      0:00:58.640000 ---> 0:01:01.040000
      We just have to build a project that feels our greed.
   Segment 35
      0:01:01.040000 ---> 0:01:02.840000
      OK, this is starting to sound a bit unethical.
   Segment 36
      0:01:02.840000 ---> 0:01:03.840000
      Maybe we should do something.
   Segment 37
      0:01:03.840000 ---> 0:01:04.440000
      Oh, money.
   Segment 38
      0:01:04.440000 ---> 0:01:06.400000
      Now that we've sold our sort of capitalism,
   Segment 39
      0:01:06.400000 ---> 0:01:09.840000
      we can use my secret business strategies for project ideas.
   Segment 40
      0:01:09.840000 ---> 0:01:10.840000
      This looks like a pyramid.
   Segment 41
      0:01:10.840000 ---> 0:01:12.720000
      Wait a minute.
   Segment 42
      0:01:12.720000 ---> 0:01:16.400000
      Strategy number one, solve a problem so small, so stupidly
   Segment 43
      0:01:16.400000 ---> 0:01:18.440000
      specific that nobody else bothers.
   Segment 44
      0:01:18.440000 ---> 0:01:20.200000
      Let me give you a beautiful example.
   Segment 45
      0:01:20.200000 ---> 0:01:22.240000
      I have a problem, and I assume other people
   Segment 46
      0:01:22.240000 ---> 0:01:23.360000
      have the same problem.
   Segment 47
      0:01:23.360000 ---> 0:01:26.880000
      I get a lot of emails, promotions, alerts, reminders,
   Segment 48
      0:01:26.880000 ---> 0:01:29.520000
      and of course, emails from people who reply to my newsletter,
   Segment 49
      0:01:29.520000 ---> 0:01:30.280000
      sloth bites.
   Segment 50
      0:01:30.280000 ---> 0:01:32.520000
      Oh, you don't know what sloth bites is?
   Segment 51
      0:01:32.520000 ---> 0:01:34.120000
      Sloth bites is my weekly newsletter,
   Segment 52
      0:01:34.120000 ---> 0:01:36.920000
      where I share bite-sized programming information every week
   Segment 53
      0:01:36.920000 ---> 0:01:38.520000
      to make you a better programmer.
   Segment 54
      0:01:38.520000 ---> 0:01:40.040000
      And the best part about it, it's free.
   Segment 55
      0:01:40.040000 ---> 0:01:41.800000
      All you have to do is give me your email.
   Segment 56
      0:01:41.800000 ---> 0:01:42.760000
      I won't do anything with it.
   Segment 57
      0:01:42.760000 ---> 0:01:44.920000
      I promise.
   Segment 58
      0:01:44.920000 ---> 0:01:46.360000
      So yeah, my emails get a lot of stuff,
   Segment 59
      0:01:46.360000 ---> 0:01:47.720000
      and I'm too lazy to categorize them.
   Segment 60
      0:01:47.720000 ---> 0:01:49.640000
      So you can make a project that categorizes emails,
   Segment 61
      0:01:49.640000 ---> 0:01:51.840000
      and I bet you could charge $5 a month for this.
   Segment 62
      0:01:51.840000 ---> 0:01:54.760000
      Get 1,000 users and bam, $5,000 a month.
   Segment 63
      0:01:54.760000 ---> 0:01:55.880000
      Wait, this already exists.
   Segment 64
      0:01:55.960000 ---> 0:01:56.920000
      Strategy number two,
   Segment 65
      0:01:56.920000 ---> 0:01:58.880000
      solve a problem so big and common
   Segment 66
      0:01:58.880000 ---> 0:02:00.800000
      that it doesn't matter if another one exists.
   Segment 67
      0:02:00.800000 ---> 0:02:02.960000
      Look, maybe the email thing has already been done,
   Segment 68
      0:02:02.960000 ---> 0:02:04.200000
      but that doesn't mean it won't work.
   Segment 69
      0:02:04.200000 ---> 0:02:06.320000
      Think about it, calendar apps, password managers,
   Segment 70
      0:02:06.320000 ---> 0:02:07.800000
      notes taking apps to do apps.
   Segment 71
      0:02:07.800000 ---> 0:02:09.720000
      There's like 500 of them, but guess what?
   Segment 72
      0:02:09.720000 ---> 0:02:11.600000
      They still make that money.
   Segment 73
      0:02:11.600000 ---> 0:02:14.200000
      Your idea doesn't have to be good or original.
   Segment 74
      0:02:14.200000 ---> 0:02:14.880000
      That's right.
   Segment 75
      0:02:14.880000 ---> 0:02:17.600000
      In fact, you can even just copy and paste someone else's idea.
   Segment 76
      0:02:17.600000 ---> 0:02:19.480000
      Big companies are a master of this.
   Segment 77
      0:02:19.480000 ---> 0:02:20.080000
      Check this out.
   Segment 78
      0:02:20.080000 ---> 0:02:20.600000
      DoorDash.
   Segment 79
      0:02:20.600000 ---> 0:02:21.280000
      UberEats.
   Segment 80
      0:02:21.280000 ---> 0:02:21.760000
      Grubhub.
   Segment 81
      0:02:21.760000 ---> 0:02:22.200000
      Rappy.
   Segment 82
      0:02:22.200000 ---> 0:02:23.600000
      Holy, there's a lot of food delivery.
   Segment 83
      0:02:23.600000 ---> 0:02:24.640000
      Strategy number three.
   Segment 84
      0:02:24.640000 ---> 0:02:26
      The X for Y formula.
   Segment 85
      0:02:26 ---> 0:02:27.920000
      Look, since we can copy businesses,
   Segment 86
      0:02:27.920000 ---> 0:02:29.760000
      we can use this classic strategy
   Segment 87
      0:02:29.760000 ---> 0:02:32.280000
      to make it look like we're doing something original.
   Segment 88
      0:02:32.280000 ---> 0:02:33.680000
      The strategy is pretty simple.
   Segment 89
      0:02:33.680000 ---> 0:02:35.920000
      The X is the specific problem or need
   Segment 90
      0:02:35.920000 ---> 0:02:36.880000
      that you're trying to solve,
   Segment 91
      0:02:36.880000 ---> 0:02:38.880000
      and then the Y is the specific group of people
   Segment 92
      0:02:38.880000 ---> 0:02:40.320000
      or market that you're trying to sell to.
   Segment 93
      0:02:40.320000 ---> 0:02:43.680000
      So imagine something like the Discord for businesses.
   Segment 94
      0:02:43.680000 ---> 0:02:45.560000
      Linux, but for normal people.
   Segment 95
      0:02:45.560000 ---> 0:02:46.360000
      UberEats.
   Segment 96
      0:02:46.360000 ---> 0:02:47.640000
      But you take people.
   Segment 97
      0:02:47.640000 ---> 0:02:48.320000
      Wait, that's just Uber.
   Segment 98
      0:02:48.320000 ---> 0:02:49.360000
      Look, it's a simple strategy.
   Segment 99
      0:02:49.360000 ---> 0:02:51.080000
      I obviously don't have any good ideas,
   Segment 100
      0:02:51.080000 ---> 0:02:51.960000
      or else I'd be rich.
   Segment 101
      0:02:51.960000 ---> 0:02:52.760000
      But you get the point, right?
   Segment 102
      0:02:52.760000 ---> 0:02:54.160000
      This strategy is really effective
   Segment 103
      0:02:54.240000 ---> 0:02:56.040000
      if you have absolutely no creative.
   Segment 104
      0:02:56.040000 ---> 0:02:56.960000
      Strategy number four.
   Segment 105
      0:02:56.960000 ---> 0:02:58.160000
      The GPT rapper.
   Segment 106
      0:02:58.160000 ---> 0:02:59.520000
      This is a brand new strategy.
   Segment 107
      0:02:59.520000 ---> 0:03:01.280000
      Thanks to Chad GPT and other AIs.
   Segment 108
      0:03:01.280000 ---> 0:03:02.680000
      And the strategy's pretty simple.
   Segment 109
      0:03:02.680000 ---> 0:03:04.400000
      You make AI do a specific task.
   Segment 110
      0:03:04.400000 ---> 0:03:05.360000
      Yeah, it's that simple.
   Segment 111
      0:03:05.360000 ---> 0:03:07.320000
      And some people have made millions off this.
   Segment 112
      0:03:07.320000 ---> 0:03:08.920000
      Like my homie Blake Anderson right here.
   Segment 113
      0:03:08.920000 ---> 0:03:09.760000
      You know what he made?
   Segment 114
      0:03:09.760000 ---> 0:03:10.560000
      RizGPT.
   Segment 115
      0:03:10.560000 ---> 0:03:11.480000
      GPT for dating.
   Segment 116
      0:03:11.480000 ---> 0:03:12.480000
      He made millions off this.
   Segment 117
      0:03:12.480000 ---> 0:03:13.440000
      Yeah, millions.
   Segment 118
      0:03:13.440000 ---> 0:03:15.440000
      Business is such a beautiful thing.
   Segment 119
      0:03:15.440000 ---> 0:03:16.640000
      Now, even if you have an idea,
   Segment 120
      0:03:16.640000 ---> 0:03:17.840000
      thanks to my four strategies,
   Segment 121
      0:03:17.840000 ---> 0:03:19.880000
      it doesn't really matter if you don't know how to build it.
   Segment 122
      0:03:19.880000 ---> 0:03:21.600000
      So let me show you how to start building these apps.
   Segment 123
      0:03:21.600000 ---> 0:03:23.560000
      You see most developers have problems here.
   Segment 124
      0:03:23.640000 ---> 0:03:26.160000
      They get stuck and it's not because they can't build it.
   Segment 125
      0:03:26.160000 ---> 0:03:27.480000
      In fact, it's the opposite.
   Segment 126
      0:03:27.480000 ---> 0:03:30.120000
      They can build it, but they want everything to be perfect.
   Segment 127
      0:03:30.120000 ---> 0:03:31.520000
      They want to keep adding features.
   Segment 128
      0:03:31.520000 ---> 0:03:32.920000
      They're worried about scaling.
   Segment 129
      0:03:32.920000 ---> 0:03:35.600000
      Bro, you have zero users.
   Segment 130
      0:03:35.600000 ---> 0:03:36.920000
      What's the point of scaling?
   Segment 131
      0:03:36.920000 ---> 0:03:39
      Because while you're worried about clean code,
   Segment 132
      0:03:39 ---> 0:03:41.080000
      scalability and best practices,
   Segment 133
      0:03:41.080000 ---> 0:03:42.880000
      someone else is launching their broken app,
   Segment 134
      0:03:42.880000 ---> 0:03:45
      getting real users and making money
   Segment 135
      0:03:45 ---> 0:03:47.120000
      with code that looks like it was written by a three year old.
   Segment 136
      0:03:47.120000 ---> 0:03:48.520000
      But thanks to modern tools,
   Segment 137
      0:03:48.520000 ---> 0:03:50.400000
      shipping garbage has never been easier.
   Segment 138
      0:03:50.400000 ---> 0:03:51.560000
      But I'll get to that part later.
   Segment 139
      0:03:51.560000 ---> 0:03:52.920000
      When you're building your project,
   Segment 140
      0:03:52.920000 ---> 0:03:54.480000
      you should follow these three rules.
   Segment 141
      0:03:54.480000 ---> 0:03:57.400000
      SLC, simple, lovable and complete.
   Segment 142
      0:03:57.400000 ---> 0:03:59.200000
      I stole this from a video from Edmund Young,
   Segment 143
      0:03:59.200000 ---> 0:04:00.520000
      but I just love the advice so much.
   Segment 144
      0:04:00.520000 ---> 0:04:01.440000
      So I'm going to steal it here.
   Segment 145
      0:04:01.440000 ---> 0:04:03.040000
      I'm sorry, Edmund, it's such good advice.
   Segment 146
      0:04:03.040000 ---> 0:04:05.480000
      Simple means that your app doesn't have to do everything,
   Segment 147
      0:04:05.480000 ---> 0:04:07.080000
      but it should at least deliver
   Segment 148
      0:04:07.080000 ---> 0:04:08.920000
      at least one to two key features.
   Segment 149
      0:04:08.920000 ---> 0:04:11.240000
      Lovable means you want people to use your app.
   Segment 150
      0:04:11.240000 ---> 0:04:13.680000
      So this just means your app should have some good UI UX.
   Segment 151
      0:04:13.680000 ---> 0:04:15.560000
      So basically, make your app look good.
   Segment 152
      0:04:15.560000 ---> 0:04:16.880000
      I'll talk more about that later.
   Segment 153
      0:04:16.880000 ---> 0:04:18.040000
      And your app should be complete.
   Segment 154
      0:04:18.040000 ---> 0:04:19.720000
      Don't make your app like the gaming industry
   Segment 155
      0:04:19.720000 ---> 0:04:21.800000
      where it's incomplete and then sell you it later.
   Segment 156
      0:04:21.800000 ---> 0:04:23.200000
      Make sure it's functional.
   Segment 157
      0:04:23.200000 ---> 0:04:25.960000
      Make sure the one to two key features you did make work.
   Segment 158
      0:04:25.960000 ---> 0:04:27.560000
      Once again, I'm taking this from Edmund.
   Segment 159
      0:04:27.560000 ---> 0:04:29.760000
      So go check out his videos later.
   Segment 160
      0:04:29.760000 ---> 0:04:31.120000
      Not now, you should watch mine first.
   Segment 161
      0:04:31.120000 ---> 0:04:34.320000
      Now I want to emphasize the L and SLC, lovable,
   Segment 162
      0:04:34.320000 ---> 0:04:35.600000
      because I don't think enough of you
   Segment 163
      0:04:35.600000 ---> 0:04:37.600000
      understand how important this part is,
   Segment 164
      0:04:37.600000 ---> 0:04:38.920000
      especially the programmers,
   Segment 165
      0:04:38.920000 ---> 0:04:40.540000
      specifically back in engineers.
   Segment 166
      0:04:40.540000 ---> 0:04:41.380000
      I'm looking at you.
   Segment 167
      0:04:41.380000 ---> 0:04:43.320000
      Please make your project look good,
   Segment 168
      0:04:43.320000 ---> 0:04:44.600000
      or at least not terrible.
   Segment 169
      0:04:44.600000 ---> 0:04:45.880000
      It's bad enough that you're ugly.
   Segment 170
      0:04:45.880000 ---> 0:04:47.400000
      Don't make your project ugly too.
   Segment 171
      0:04:48.440000 ---> 0:04:51.240000
      Most of you probably only care about the programming part.
   Segment 172
      0:04:51.240000 ---> 0:04:53.360000
      You want to get things done, even if it looks ugly.
   Segment 173
      0:04:53.360000 ---> 0:04:55.880000
      And I respect that, but you're trying to sell this project
   Segment 174
      0:04:55.880000 ---> 0:04:56.720000
      to other people.
   Segment 175
      0:04:56.720000 ---> 0:04:58.040000
      Here's the thing about us humans.
   Segment 176
      0:04:58.040000 ---> 0:05:00.800000
      We're shallow, very shallow.
   Segment 177
      0:05:00.800000 ---> 0:05:04.240000
      You could have the best code ever in, revolutionary features.
   Segment 178
      0:05:04.240000 ---> 0:05:06.720000
      But if it looks ugly, nobody's going to use it.
   Segment 179
      0:05:06.720000 ---> 0:05:09.040000
      I mean, there's exceptions, of course, like Craigslist
   Segment 180
      0:05:09.040000 ---> 0:05:10.200000
      and Craigslist.
   Segment 181
      0:05:10.200000 ---> 0:05:13.320000
      But imagine if Craigslist just looked a little better.
   Segment 182
      0:05:13.320000 ---> 0:05:14.720000
      Design is really important.
   Segment 183
      0:05:14.720000 ---> 0:05:17.160000
      Now you could spend years learning design,
   Segment 184
      0:05:17.160000 ---> 0:05:20.040000
      studying UI patterns, taking screenshots of every app
   Segment 185
      0:05:20.040000 ---> 0:05:21.600000
      to learn how to make a good looking website,
   Segment 186
      0:05:21.600000 ---> 0:05:23.720000
      or you could use this tool to help you out.
   Segment 187
      0:05:23.720000 ---> 0:05:25.080000
      Marvin, now what's Marvin?
   Segment 188
      0:05:25.080000 ---> 0:05:26.920000
      Marvin's a really useful tool for design,
   Segment 189
      0:05:26.920000 ---> 0:05:29.160000
      and I'm so happy a platform like this exists.
   Segment 190
      0:05:29.160000 ---> 0:05:31.640000
      You can think of them like the paparazzi for design,
   Segment 191
      0:05:31.640000 ---> 0:05:33.920000
      because they take pictures of everything.
   Segment 192
      0:05:33.920000 ---> 0:05:34.920000
      Marvin, don't get mad at that.
   Segment 193
      0:05:34.920000 ---> 0:05:36.680000
      And they're also the sponsor of today's video.
   Segment 194
      0:05:36.680000 ---> 0:05:37.520000
      I knew it.
   Segment 195
      0:05:37.520000 ---> 0:05:39.400000
      It's a platform that lets you look at websites
   Segment 196
      0:05:39.400000 ---> 0:05:41.440000
      and mobile apps to get some design inspiration
   Segment 197
      0:05:41.440000 ---> 0:05:43.160000
      and see how other applications do things.
   Segment 198
      0:05:43.160000 ---> 0:05:44.960000
      Let me give you some quick facts about Marvin
   Segment 199
      0:05:44.960000 ---> 0:05:45.840000
      that'll blow you away.
   Segment 200
      0:05:45.840000 ---> 0:05:49.360000
      They have over 1,200 apps, over 500,000 screenshots,
   Segment 201
      0:05:49.360000 ---> 0:05:51.200000
      and over 80,000 user flows.
   Segment 202
      0:05:51.200000 ---> 0:05:52.480000
      Yeah, it's a cheat code for design.
   Segment 203
      0:05:52.480000 ---> 0:05:53.960000
      It's updated every single week,
   Segment 204
      0:05:53.960000 ---> 0:05:55.720000
      and their mission is to empower the world
   Segment 205
      0:05:55.720000 ---> 0:05:57.400000
      to design great digital experiences.
   Segment 206
      0:05:57.400000 ---> 0:06:00.040000
      So basically, Marvin wants to make every website
   Segment 207
      0:06:00.040000 ---> 0:06:00.880000
      and app look good.
   Segment 208
      0:06:00.880000 ---> 0:06:03.080000
      You can check out how other companies do signups,
   Segment 209
      0:06:03.080000 ---> 0:06:05.600000
      logins, their homepage, dashboards, checkouts,
   Segment 210
      0:06:05.600000 ---> 0:06:06.440000
      really anything.
   Segment 211
      0:06:06.440000 ---> 0:06:07.960000
      A lot of designers rely on Marvin
   Segment 212
      0:06:07.960000 ---> 0:06:09.800000
      as a source of inspiration and best practices,
   Segment 213
      0:06:09.800000 ---> 0:06:11.160000
      because well, they have everything.
   Segment 214
      0:06:11.160000 ---> 0:06:12.240000
      I mean, look how easy this is.
   Segment 215
      0:06:12.240000 ---> 0:06:13.240000
      I need a landing page.
   Segment 216
      0:06:13.240000 ---> 0:06:14.080000
      I go on Marvin.
   Segment 217
      0:06:14.080000 ---> 0:06:16.120000
      Boom, this is how 500 apps did their landing page.
   Segment 218
      0:06:16.120000 ---> 0:06:18.040000
      It's quick and easy to find exactly what you need.
   Segment 219
      0:06:18.040000 ---> 0:06:20.560000
      No more random screenshots, no more guessing what works.
   Segment 220
      0:06:20.560000 ---> 0:06:22.160000
      Marvin already has everything for you,
   Segment 221
      0:06:22.160000 ---> 0:06:24.240000
      and you might even learn a thing or two about UIUX.
   Segment 222
      0:06:24.240000 ---> 0:06:25.920000
      So if you'd like to try Marvin for free
   Segment 223
      0:06:25.920000 ---> 0:06:27.400000
      and start making beautiful projects,
   Segment 224
      0:06:27.400000 ---> 0:06:28.480000
      click the link in the description.
   Segment 225
      0:06:28.480000 ---> 0:06:29.800000
      Now that we have our design cheat code,
   Segment 226
      0:06:29.800000 ---> 0:06:30.840000
      and I sold my soul a bit,
   Segment 227
      0:06:30.840000 ---> 0:06:33.120000
      let's get a bit more technical and start building.
   Segment 228
      0:06:33.120000 ---> 0:06:35
      Your application is gonna need four parts.
   Segment 229
      0:06:35 ---> 0:06:36.920000
      Front end, the back end, database,
   Segment 230
      0:06:36.920000 ---> 0:06:38
      and a payment processor.
   Segment 231
      0:06:38 ---> 0:06:39.640000
      And when people think of these four steps,
   Segment 232
      0:06:39.640000 ---> 0:06:40.880000
      they usually have to think of a-
   Segment 233
      0:06:40.880000 ---> 0:06:41.720000
      Text stack.
   Segment 234
      0:06:41.720000 ---> 0:06:43.680000
      Ah, yes, the text stack.
   Segment 235
      0:06:43.680000 ---> 0:06:45.760000
      A landmine full of opinions.
   Segment 236
      0:06:45.760000 ---> 0:06:48.760000
      Now when it comes to text stack specifically to make money,
   Segment 237
      0:06:48.760000 ---> 0:06:50.040000
      your text stack doesn't really matter.
   Segment 238
      0:06:50.040000 ---> 0:06:51.920000
      The only people that care about your text stack
   Segment 239
      0:06:51.920000 ---> 0:06:52.960000
      are tech bros on Twitter.
   Segment 240
      0:06:52.960000 ---> 0:06:53.800000
      It's X now.
   Segment 241
      0:06:53.800000 ---> 0:06:54.840000
      I'm not saying that.
   Segment 242
      0:06:54.840000 ---> 0:06:55.920000
      And they're not gonna buy your product.
   Segment 243
      0:06:55.920000 ---> 0:06:56.880000
      They're gonna build it themselves.
   Segment 244
      0:06:56.880000 ---> 0:06:58.560000
      So you could honestly use whatever you want.
   Segment 245
      0:06:58.560000 ---> 0:07:00.960000
      WordPress, scratch, JavaScript, Python.
   Segment 246
      0:07:00.960000 ---> 0:07:02.680000
      You could write your app in call wall for all I care.
   Segment 247
      0:07:02.680000 ---> 0:07:05.080000
      The only thing that matters is if your app works.
   Segment 248
      0:07:05.080000 ---> 0:07:07.680000
      The only recommendations I will give you about a text stack
   Segment 249
      0:07:07.680000 ---> 0:07:09.360000
      is use something that's popular,
   Segment 250
      0:07:09.360000 ---> 0:07:10.880000
      that has a lot of developer support,
   Segment 251
      0:07:10.880000 ---> 0:07:11.920000
      has a large community,
   Segment 252
      0:07:11.920000 ---> 0:07:13.280000
      and that you're the most comfortable with.
   Segment 253
      0:07:13.280000 ---> 0:07:14.160000
      At the end of the day,
   Segment 254
      0:07:14.160000 ---> 0:07:15.480000
      if you can't get any work done,
   Segment 255
      0:07:15.480000 ---> 0:07:16.320000
      what's the point?
   Segment 256
      0:07:16.320000 ---> 0:07:17.520000
      Now what I like to use personally,
   Segment 257
      0:07:17.520000 ---> 0:07:19.480000
      and this is specifically for web development,
   Segment 258
      0:07:19.480000 ---> 0:07:21.680000
      I like to use the next JS and Superbase,
   Segment 259
      0:07:21.680000 ---> 0:07:24.720000
      and I like to style my apps with Shatsian and Tillwind.
   Segment 260
      0:07:24.720000 ---> 0:07:25.960000
      I love Shatsian.
   Segment 261
      0:07:25.960000 ---> 0:07:29.080000
      And then I like to use post-log for analytics to track you all.
   Segment 262
      0:07:29.080000 ---> 0:07:30.840000
      And then I use Stripe for payment processing
   Segment 263
      0:07:30.840000 ---> 0:07:31.760000
      so I can take all your money.
   Segment 264
      0:07:31.760000 ---> 0:07:33.880000
      Yeah, that's the text stack I like to use right now.
   Segment 265
      0:07:33.880000 ---> 0:07:35.040000
      This could change in the future
   Segment 266
      0:07:35.040000 ---> 0:07:36.840000
      because there's a lot of tools and frameworks out there
   Segment 267
      0:07:36.840000 ---> 0:07:38.120000
      that I haven't used personally,
   Segment 268
      0:07:38.120000 ---> 0:07:39.280000
      but this does get the job done.
   Segment 269
      0:07:39.280000 ---> 0:07:40.360000
      It's up to you if you wanna use it.
   Segment 270
      0:07:40.360000 ---> 0:07:41.520000
      Hey, hi, cool.
   Segment 271
      0:07:41.520000 ---> 0:07:44
      Remember when I said shipping garbage has never been easier?
   Segment 272
      0:07:44 ---> 0:07:44.840000
      This is what I meant.
   Segment 273
      0:07:44.840000 ---> 0:07:46.280000
      Now AI is not perfect
   Segment 274
      0:07:46.280000 ---> 0:07:48.640000
      and people have mixed opinions about it for programming.
   Segment 275
      0:07:48.640000 ---> 0:07:51.160000
      My advice would be if the goal of this project is to learn,
   Segment 276
      0:07:51.160000 ---> 0:07:52.240000
      I don't recommend using it,
   Segment 277
      0:07:52.240000 ---> 0:07:54.400000
      but in our case, it's to sell out and make money.
   Segment 278
      0:07:54.400000 ---> 0:07:55.240000
      So who cares?
   Segment 279
      0:07:55.240000 ---> 0:07:56.800000
      Now obviously AI isn't perfect,
   Segment 280
      0:07:56.800000 ---> 0:07:59.080000
      it's not gonna give you the entire project yet,
   Segment 281
      0:07:59.080000 ---> 0:08:00.560000
      but I will say it's very helpful
   Segment 282
      0:08:00.560000 ---> 0:08:02.840000
      to get stuff done fast, specifically annoying stuff.
   Segment 283
      0:08:02.840000 ---> 0:08:05.760000
      AI is a very helpful tool, no matter how you look at it.
   Segment 284
      0:08:05.760000 ---> 0:08:07.720000
      Now there's levels to how you can use AI.
   Segment 285
      0:08:07.720000 ---> 0:08:08.840000
      We got the normy level,
   Segment 286
      0:08:08.840000 ---> 0:08:11.640000
      which is just the basic AI chats like chat GPT,
   Segment 287
      0:08:11.680000 ---> 0:08:14.880000
      quad, Gemini, does anyone actually use the Gemini chat?
   Segment 288
      0:08:14.880000 ---> 0:08:16.880000
      And then we have the tri-hard sweat level,
   Segment 289
      0:08:16.880000 ---> 0:08:19.640000
      which are using tools that are specifically made for coding.
   Segment 290
      0:08:19.640000 ---> 0:08:23
      There's tools like Bolt, V0, and level bowl
   Segment 291
      0:08:23 ---> 0:08:25.440000
      that basically build the full stack application.
   Segment 292
      0:08:25.440000 ---> 0:08:27
      They obviously can't build the entire thing,
   Segment 293
      0:08:27 ---> 0:08:28.400000
      but they do give a good starting point.
   Segment 294
      0:08:28.400000 ---> 0:08:29.880000
      I mean, check this out, I'll use Bolt for this.
   Segment 295
      0:08:29.880000 ---> 0:08:31.320000
      You give a description of what you want
   Segment 296
      0:08:31.320000 ---> 0:08:32.800000
      and Bolt just builds it for you.
   Segment 297
      0:08:32.800000 ---> 0:08:34.160000
      Oh my God.
   Segment 298
      0:08:34.160000 ---> 0:08:36.360000
      There's also AI code editors like cursor,
   Segment 299
      0:08:36.360000 ---> 0:08:38.320000
      windsurf, and pair, shout out name.
   Segment 300
      0:08:38.320000 ---> 0:08:40.800000
      AI inside your code editors might become the norm soon,
   Segment 301
      0:08:40.840000 ---> 0:08:42.280000
      at least for non-enterprise projects,
   Segment 302
      0:08:42.280000 ---> 0:08:43.840000
      because they're really helpful.
   Segment 303
      0:08:43.840000 ---> 0:08:46.080000
      It's great, you should check out one of these AI code editors,
   Segment 304
      0:08:46.080000 ---> 0:08:47.280000
      but where was I?
   Segment 305
      0:08:47.280000 ---> 0:08:48.880000
      All right, how to make projects that make money.
   Segment 306
      0:08:48.880000 ---> 0:08:51.440000
      You now have your app idea that'll make you millions.
   Segment 307
      0:08:51.440000 ---> 0:08:52.960000
      All you have to do now is build it.
   Segment 308
      0:08:52.960000 ---> 0:08:54.800000
      Let me give you the ultimate workflow
   Segment 309
      0:08:54.800000 ---> 0:08:57.600000
      so you can finish that app in a week.
   Segment 310
      0:08:57.600000 ---> 0:09:00.400000
      Step one, get a description and outline of the project.
   Segment 311
      0:09:00.400000 ---> 0:09:03.080000
      Go to chat GPT, describe the project you wanna make,
   Segment 312
      0:09:03.080000 ---> 0:09:05.280000
      and tell chat GPT to create a detailed
   Segment 313
      0:09:05.280000 ---> 0:09:07
      and structured explanation of the app,
   Segment 314
      0:09:07 ---> 0:09:08.120000
      because you don't even know
   Segment 315
      0:09:08.120000 ---> 0:09:09.360000
      what you're building yourself yet.
   Segment 316
      0:09:09.360000 ---> 0:09:13.400000
      Step two, use an AI tool like V0, Bolt, or Lovable,
   Segment 317
      0:09:13.400000 ---> 0:09:15.920000
      and copy and paste that detailed explanation
   Segment 318
      0:09:15.920000 ---> 0:09:17
      to one of those tools.
   Segment 319
      0:09:17 ---> 0:09:18.360000
      It'll start building it for you
   Segment 320
      0:09:18.360000 ---> 0:09:19.880000
      and give you a good starting point.
   Segment 321
      0:09:19.880000 ---> 0:09:21.760000
      Step three, fix the UI.
   Segment 322
      0:09:21.760000 ---> 0:09:24.960000
      These tools are most likely gonna generate terrible UI,
   Segment 323
      0:09:24.960000 ---> 0:09:26.960000
      so what you can do now is go onto mobbin
   Segment 324
      0:09:26.960000 ---> 0:09:29.040000
      and look at any designs that you think look good,
   Segment 325
      0:09:29.040000 ---> 0:09:30.600000
      copy the images from mobbin,
   Segment 326
      0:09:30.600000 ---> 0:09:32.840000
      and paste them into the tool that you use to build the app,
   Segment 327
      0:09:32.840000 ---> 0:09:34.400000
      and tell it to make it look like that.
   Segment 328
      0:09:34.400000 ---> 0:09:37
      Step four, start programming it yourself.
   Segment 329
      0:09:37 ---> 0:09:38.360000
      Even though you have a starting point,
   Segment 330
      0:09:38.360000 ---> 0:09:40.880000
      these tools are not gonna build the whole thing for you.
   Segment 331
      0:09:40.880000 ---> 0:09:43.440000
      You actually have to use your brain and code it yourself.
   Segment 332
      0:09:43.440000 ---> 0:09:45.960000
      So you ink the code that it gave you, start coding,
   Segment 333
      0:09:45.960000 ---> 0:09:47.240000
      and there you go, my friend.
   Segment 334
      0:09:47.240000 ---> 0:09:48.560000
      You now have a starting point
   Segment 335
      0:09:48.560000 ---> 0:09:51.360000
      to making your next million dollar application.
   Segment 336
      0:09:51.360000 ---> 0:09:52.800000
      Now that you've finished the project,
   Segment 337
      0:09:52.800000 ---> 0:09:54.560000
      all you have to do now is wait,
   Segment 338
      0:09:54.560000 ---> 0:09:56.560000
      and the users will start coming.
   Segment 339
      0:09:57.520000 ---> 0:09:58.360000
      Where's the user?
   Segment 340
      0:09:58.360000 ---> 0:09:59.200000
      Mark it in.
   Segment 341
      0:09:59.200000 ---> 0:10:00.880000
      Now even though you finished building your project,
   Segment 342
      0:10:00.880000 ---> 0:10:03.040000
      you'd think people would just visit it normally.
   Segment 343
      0:10:03.040000 ---> 0:10:04.080000
      Well, you're wrong.
   Segment 344
      0:10:04.080000 ---> 0:10:05.760000
      Even once you finish building your project
   Segment 345
      0:10:05.760000 ---> 0:10:07.080000
      and you publish it to the internet,
   Segment 346
      0:10:07.080000 ---> 0:10:08.400000
      literally nothing happens.
   Segment 347
      0:10:08.400000 ---> 0:10:09.360000
      Absolutely nothing.
   Segment 348
      0:10:09.360000 ---> 0:10:10.440000
      Nobody knows it exists.
   Segment 349
      0:10:10.440000 ---> 0:10:11.400000
      Nobody's gonna use it.
   Segment 350
      0:10:11.400000 ---> 0:10:12.480000
      Your mom's not gonna use it.
   Segment 351
      0:10:12.480000 ---> 0:10:13.400000
      Your dad's not gonna use it.
   Segment 352
      0:10:13.400000 ---> 0:10:14.360000
      Your uncle's not gonna use it.
   Segment 353
      0:10:14.360000 ---> 0:10:15.600000
      Your grandma's not gonna use it.
   Segment 354
      0:10:15.600000 ---> 0:10:17.560000
      Your project goes straight to the void of the internet,
   Segment 355
      0:10:17.560000 ---> 0:10:18.960000
      which is why we need marketing.
   Segment 356
      0:10:18.960000 ---> 0:10:21.160000
      All you need to do is be slightly annoying,
   Segment 357
      0:10:21.160000 ---> 0:10:23.440000
      kinda everywhere, and a little bit cringe.
   Segment 358
      0:10:23.440000 ---> 0:10:25.640000
      And there's already a place that does exactly that.
   Segment 359
      0:10:25.640000 ---> 0:10:26.960000
      Social media.
   Segment 360
      0:10:26.960000 ---> 0:10:27.800000
      Woo!
   Segment 361
      0:10:27.800000 ---> 0:10:28.920000
      Reddit, free users.
   Segment 362
      0:10:28.920000 ---> 0:10:30.360000
      Twitter, free marketing.
   Segment 363
      0:10:30.360000 ---> 0:10:32.240000
      LinkedIn, free customers.
   Segment 364
      0:10:32.240000 ---> 0:10:34.360000
      You have to start thinking like a business person.
   Segment 365
      0:10:34.360000 ---> 0:10:36.680000
      You gotta stop thinking about people as people.
   Segment 366
      0:10:36.680000 ---> 0:10:39.880000
      You have to start looking at them as numbers and money.
   Segment 367
      0:10:39.880000 ---> 0:10:42.520000
      Go on LinkedIn and post about your entrepreneurship journey
   Segment 368
      0:10:42.520000 ---> 0:10:43.520000
      and link your project,
   Segment 369
      0:10:43.520000 ---> 0:10:45.160000
      and people are gonna eat that stuff up.
   Segment 370
      0:10:45.160000 ---> 0:10:46.600000
      It's that simple nowadays.
   Segment 371
      0:10:46.600000 ---> 0:10:49.440000
      Go on TikTok, post some cringe TikToks about your product,
   Segment 372
      0:10:49.440000 ---> 0:10:50.680000
      and people are bound to see it.
   Segment 373
      0:10:50.680000 ---> 0:10:53.560000
      Go on YouTube, post some terrible videos about your product.
   Segment 374
      0:10:53.560000 ---> 0:10:55
      People are bound to see it.
   Segment 375
      0:10:55 ---> 0:10:56.640000
      Even if your video gets a little views,
   Segment 376
      0:10:56.640000 ---> 0:10:59.240000
      you could just buy ads and people will have to see it
   Segment 377
      0:10:59.240000 ---> 0:11:00.320000
      because you paid for it.
   Segment 378
      0:11:00.320000 ---> 0:11:01.920000
      So keep posting about your project,
   Segment 379
      0:11:02 ---> 0:11:04.480000
      keep being annoying, and people will eventually try it.
   Segment 380
      0:11:04.480000 ---> 0:11:06.760000
      Now combine social media marketing with SEO,
   Segment 381
      0:11:06.760000 ---> 0:11:08.120000
      search engine optimization,
   Segment 382
      0:11:08.120000 ---> 0:11:10.680000
      mix up your HTML and add some metadata to your project,
   Segment 383
      0:11:10.680000 ---> 0:11:12.520000
      get your project to the top of Google searches.
   Segment 384
      0:11:12.520000 ---> 0:11:13.840000
      You already know what I'm gonna say.
   Segment 385
      0:11:13.840000 ---> 0:11:15.800000
      People are bound to see it.
   Segment 386
      0:11:15.800000 ---> 0:11:17.600000
      And if your product actually is good,
   Segment 387
      0:11:17.600000 ---> 0:11:20.240000
      it'll get popular and people will actually buy it.
   Segment 388
      0:11:20.240000 ---> 0:11:23.240000
      And you'll finally be rich and live your dream life.
   Segment 389
      0:11:23.240000 ---> 0:11:25.520000
      And if you successfully get rich from this video,
   Segment 390
      0:11:25.520000 ---> 0:11:27.800000
      split me the check because you owe me.
   Segment 391
      0:11:27.800000 ---> 0:11:28.800000
      I made you.

Transcription for I SOLD my AI startup for $200,000 (yes, again).mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:04.800000
      I officially sold my app for $200,000. I got the money on my account.
   Segment 2
      0:00:04.800000 ---> 0:00:07.920000
      This is me, back in July 2024.
   Segment 3
      0:00:07.920000 ---> 0:00:12.360000
      And this started by sold, I created it in only one week and work on it for less than a year.
   Segment 4
      0:00:12.360000 ---> 0:00:17.440000
      I documented the whole process and the moment I got the idea for my first customers up to the final sale.
   Segment 5
      0:00:17.440000 ---> 0:00:20.920000
      So if you're ready, take a seat and let's go back in time two years ago.
   Segment 6
      0:00:23.560000 ---> 0:00:25.560000
      So it's just me and my laptop.
   Segment 7
      0:00:25.560000 ---> 0:00:34.680000
      After selling my previous startup for $65,000, I took some time off the rest.
   Segment 8
      0:00:34.680000 ---> 0:00:40.600000
      The danger of running out of money in the next few months was gone, but since I sold my main source of income,
   Segment 9
      0:00:40.600000 ---> 0:00:42
      I didn't have income anymore.
   Segment 10
      0:00:42 ---> 0:00:46.760000
      So I couldn't say like that and do nothing forever or I would run off of money eventually.
   Segment 11
      0:00:46.760000 ---> 0:00:50.120000
      So it was time to get back to work to create a new source of income.
   Segment 12
      0:00:50.120000 ---> 0:00:54.280000
      Now, you know the saying, if something is not broken, don't fix it.
   Segment 13
      0:00:54.280000 ---> 0:00:57.360000
      I just had to repeat exactly what I did with my previous startup.
   Segment 14
      0:00:57.360000 ---> 0:00:59.960000
      Find an ID, build it quickly and make money.
   Segment 15
      0:01:01.720000 ---> 0:01:05.680000
      My goal was to make a startup I could grow mainly using Facebook advertising
   Segment 16
      0:01:05.680000 ---> 0:01:08.480000
      since I have seven years of experience in advertising.
   Segment 17
      0:01:08.480000 ---> 0:01:12.360000
      Or but Facebook is dead or Tony Boon will use it. I don't even go there anymore.
   Segment 18
      0:01:12.360000 ---> 0:01:24.520000
      Remember, it's not because you do something that everyone does.
   Segment 19
      0:01:24.520000 ---> 0:01:26.760000
      But why Facebook ads? Simple.
   Segment 20
      0:01:26.760000 ---> 0:01:30.360000
      Ads on Facebook can reach massive audience very quickly.
   Segment 21
      0:01:30.360000 ---> 0:01:34.920000
      And unlike Google ads, where you are limited by the number of people looking for specific keywords,
   Segment 22
      0:01:34.920000 ---> 0:01:38.720000
      Facebook ads literally reach pretty much anyone in the world.
   Segment 23
      0:01:38.720000 ---> 0:01:41.800000
      But there is one crucial requirement for this to work.
   Segment 24
      0:01:41.880000 ---> 0:01:45.320000
      If the audience is too small or cannot clearly be identified,
   Segment 25
      0:01:45.320000 ---> 0:01:47.880000
      Facebook might have a hard time finding customers.
   Segment 26
      0:01:47.880000 ---> 0:01:51.240000
      With that in mind, it was just a matter of finding the right ID.
   Segment 27
      0:01:51.240000 ---> 0:01:52.600000
      How do you pronounce ID?
   Segment 28
      0:01:52.600000 ---> 0:01:55.960000
      With that in mind, it was just a matter of finding the right idea.
   Segment 29
      0:01:59.720000 ---> 0:02:04.280000
      I was trying to write something on Google Docs while I noticed a transcription button.
   Segment 30
      0:02:04.280000 ---> 0:02:07
      So I tried it and...
   Segment 31
      0:02:07 ---> 0:02:08.680000
      Yep, that was shit.
   Segment 32
      0:02:08.680000 ---> 0:02:11.560000
      I tried multiple times, started to get frustrated
   Segment 33
      0:02:11.560000 ---> 0:02:13
      and was ready to give up.
   Segment 34
      0:02:13 ---> 0:02:17.640000
      But then, I realized, surely, I wasn't the only one who was too lazy to type
   Segment 35
      0:02:17.640000 ---> 0:02:19.400000
      and would prefer to speak instead.
   Segment 36
      0:02:19.400000 ---> 0:02:20.920000
      Which means...
   Segment 37
      0:02:20.920000 ---> 0:02:22.680000
      That could be a startup ID.
   Segment 38
      0:02:22.680000 ---> 0:02:28.040000
      And perfect timing, some new AI models for audio transcription were released a few months earlier.
   Segment 39
      0:02:28.040000 ---> 0:02:29.400000
      So I could just use that.
   Segment 40
      0:02:29.400000 ---> 0:02:33.160000
      And even better, this ID fits all the criteria of a good startup ID.
   Segment 41
      0:02:33.160000 ---> 0:02:35.560000
      It provides value because it helps do something faster.
   Segment 42
      0:02:35.560000 ---> 0:02:36.760000
      It has a large scale.
   Segment 43
      0:02:36.760000 ---> 0:02:38.200000
      Everyone wants to write faster.
   Segment 44
      0:02:38.200000 ---> 0:02:40.280000
      I did have the technical skills to do it,
   Segment 45
      0:02:40.280000 ---> 0:02:42.040000
      and I had distribution with ads.
   Segment 46
      0:02:42.040000 ---> 0:02:44.600000
      So, without waiting, I went to work.
   Segment 47
      0:02:44.600000 ---> 0:02:47.480000
      I set myself a deadline of one week to code the app.
   Segment 48
      0:02:47.480000 ---> 0:02:51.160000
      And after one week, it's impossible you need months to launch a startup,
   Segment 49
      0:02:51.160000 ---> 0:02:52.840000
      you, my friend, are wrong.
   Segment 50
      0:02:53.560000 ---> 0:02:55.080000
      Now, let's be real.
   Segment 51
      0:02:55.080000 ---> 0:02:56.840000
      Failure is a norm in startups.
   Segment 52
      0:02:58.040000 ---> 0:02:59.960000
      99% of new started fail.
   Segment 53
      0:03:03 ---> 0:03:06.040000
      So we are going to assume your ID as good as it is...
   Segment 54
      0:03:07.640000 ---> 0:03:08.680000
      will fail.
   Segment 55
      0:03:08.760000 ---> 0:03:11.240000
      Now, if you knew your ID will fail,
   Segment 56
      0:03:11.240000 ---> 0:03:13.560000
      will you still spend four months working on it?
   Segment 57
      0:03:15.480000 ---> 0:03:18.760000
      When you launch a new startup, there is only one thing that matters.
   Segment 58
      0:03:18.760000 ---> 0:03:23
      Figuring out as early as possible if people would be willing to pay for it.
   Segment 59
      0:03:23 ---> 0:03:24.200000
      And having short deadlines...
   Segment 60
      0:03:27.080000 ---> 0:03:29.160000
      forces you to focus on the essential.
   Segment 61
      0:03:29.160000 ---> 0:03:32.840000
      Until you have proof that people are willing to pay for your product...
   Segment 62
      0:03:35.560000 ---> 0:03:36.360000
      Nothing else matters.
   Segment 63
      0:03:36.840000 ---> 0:03:41.400000
      So, make a first version with only the essential features.
   Segment 64
      0:03:42.040000 ---> 0:03:44.120000
      Then, if it works, add more.
   Segment 65
      0:03:44.120000 ---> 0:03:47.960000
      Or simply say, don't fix bugs if there is no customer to experience them.
   Segment 66
      0:03:49.400000 ---> 0:03:52.920000
      So, after a week of grinding, I had my first version ready,
   Segment 67
      0:03:52.920000 ---> 0:03:54.840000
      and it was no time to find a name.
   Segment 68
      0:03:54.840000 ---> 0:03:58.280000
      It's a website to make notes by Tolkien.
   Segment 69
      0:03:58.920000 ---> 0:04:00.520000
      So I call it Tolkien.
   Segment 70
      0:04:01.080000 ---> 0:04:03.240000
      Yeah, creativity was never my strength.
   Segment 71
      0:04:03.720000 ---> 0:04:07.960000
      Now, I have a general rule of never spending more than what a project generates.
   Segment 72
      0:04:07.960000 ---> 0:04:11.640000
      So, paydads would have to wait a little bit until I got revenue first.
   Segment 73
      0:04:11.640000 ---> 0:04:14.040000
      But how can I generate revenue without ads then?
   Segment 74
      0:04:15.560000 ---> 0:04:19.080000
      Startup directories are websites that showcase new startups.
   Segment 75
      0:04:19.080000 ---> 0:04:22.600000
      People visiting those websites are what we call early adopters.
   Segment 76
      0:04:22.600000 ---> 0:04:26.680000
      They actively search for new tech products to try them before everyone else.
   Segment 77
      0:04:26.680000 ---> 0:04:29.400000
      So, when you have a new product that's a bit innovative,
   Segment 78
      0:04:29.400000 ---> 0:04:31
      it's a great place to get started.
   Segment 79
      0:04:31 ---> 0:04:34.440000
      So, I spent two hours looking where similar startups were listed,
   Segment 80
      0:04:34.440000 ---> 0:04:36.120000
      and added mine everywhere I could.
   Segment 81
      0:04:36.120000 ---> 0:04:37.080000
      And it worked.
   Segment 82
      0:04:37.080000 ---> 0:04:39.560000
      I got a little bit of traffic from those directories,
   Segment 83
      0:04:39.560000 ---> 0:04:42.920000
      and even made $700 of sales in a couple of days.
   Segment 84
      0:04:42.920000 ---> 0:04:44.520000
      Sure, it's not a life-changing amount,
   Segment 85
      0:04:44.520000 ---> 0:04:49
      but it was just enough to show me this idea had potential and to focus all in.
   Segment 86
      0:04:49 ---> 0:04:52.200000
      However, after a few weeks, the sales slowed on
   Segment 87
      0:04:52.200000 ---> 0:04:54.360000
      until the point where this stopped completely.
   Segment 88
      0:04:55.160000 ---> 0:04:56.840000
      So, what happened?
   Segment 89
      0:04:56.840000 ---> 0:04:59.320000
      Well, you see, a launch is an event.
   Segment 90
      0:04:59.400000 ---> 0:05:03.240000
      You will get a spike of traffic, but eventually, it will die down.
   Segment 91
      0:05:03.240000 ---> 0:05:06.920000
      The only way to fix this is to have a long-term distribution strategy,
   Segment 92
      0:05:06.920000 ---> 0:05:10.440000
      like SEO, paid ads, direct outreach, etc.
   Segment 93
      0:05:10.440000 ---> 0:05:14.200000
      All simply said, a way to get people visiting your website every day.
   Segment 94
      0:05:14.200000 ---> 0:05:19
      Problem was, the website was still not generating enough revenue to reinvest in ads,
   Segment 95
      0:05:19 ---> 0:05:21.880000
      and I wasn't really good with other distribution channels.
   Segment 96
      0:05:21.880000 ---> 0:05:23.560000
      So, guess what I did?
   Segment 97
      0:05:23.560000 ---> 0:05:26.920000
      Well, truth is, I had no idea what to do,
   Segment 98
      0:05:26.920000 ---> 0:05:31.080000
      and because of that, I got depressed and almost completely gave up on the project.
   Segment 99
      0:05:31.080000 ---> 0:05:35.240000
      And I feel that's something no one talks about on YouTube or online.
   Segment 100
      0:05:35.240000 ---> 0:05:38.360000
      Sometimes, it just sucks, and you will feel like shit,
   Segment 101
      0:05:38.360000 ---> 0:05:41.240000
      and unfortunately, that's just entrepreneurship.
   Segment 102
      0:05:41.240000 ---> 0:05:42.440000
      Not everyone will make it.
   Segment 103
      0:05:43.560000 ---> 0:05:45.320000
      At least, one thing was clear.
   Segment 104
      0:05:45.320000 ---> 0:05:47.400000
      If I wanted this project to go anywhere,
   Segment 105
      0:05:47.400000 ---> 0:05:50.200000
      I had to figure out a way to get consistent revenues.
   Segment 106
      0:05:50.200000 ---> 0:05:53.880000
      The first thing I did was to switch to a subscription model
   Segment 107
      0:05:53.880000 ---> 0:05:56.760000
      where people pay every month to access and use the app.
   Segment 108
      0:05:56.760000 ---> 0:05:58.520000
      That would make revenue more predictable.
   Segment 109
      0:05:58.520000 ---> 0:06:00.840000
      To find new users, I tried different things,
   Segment 110
      0:06:00.840000 ---> 0:06:05
      like ranking higher on Google, sending direct email to the potential customers,
   Segment 111
      0:06:05 ---> 0:06:05.560000
      and more.
   Segment 112
      0:06:05.560000 ---> 0:06:08.520000
      While I got some results from it, it was still very slow.
   Segment 113
      0:06:08.520000 ---> 0:06:10.680000
      But I had one card I didn't use yet.
   Segment 114
      0:06:10.680000 ---> 0:06:13.960000
      And if you saw my previous video, you can probably guess what it is.
   Segment 115
      0:06:14.840000 ---> 0:06:16.440000
      Hey, Nico from The Prison here,
   Segment 116
      0:06:16.440000 ---> 0:06:19.560000
      because yeah, I actually recorded this video six months ago.
   Segment 117
      0:06:19.560000 ---> 0:06:21.640000
      I just wanted to add a quick disclaimer.
   Segment 118
      0:06:21.640000 ---> 0:06:23.320000
      I'm going to talk about product hands,
   Segment 119
      0:06:23.320000 ---> 0:06:26.120000
      but lots of things change with product hands since
   Segment 120
      0:06:26.600000 ---> 0:06:28.200000
      this video was recorded.
   Segment 121
      0:06:28.200000 ---> 0:06:31.400000
      To get it simple, you probably won't get featured,
   Segment 122
      0:06:31.400000 ---> 0:06:33.400000
      but you still get a backlink.
   Segment 123
      0:06:33.400000 ---> 0:06:35.480000
      So it's still worth it to learn there,
   Segment 124
      0:06:35.480000 ---> 0:06:40.200000
      but you probably won't get featured and get like a big spike of traffic and all that.
   Segment 125
      0:06:40.840000 ---> 0:06:42.520000
      So yeah, just a quick disclaimer.
   Segment 126
      0:06:43.160000 ---> 0:06:44.120000
      Yeah, that's it.
   Segment 127
      0:06:44.120000 ---> 0:06:44.840000
      Back to the video.
   Segment 128
      0:06:45.480000 ---> 0:06:48.200000
      Product hand is a website where new tech products
   Segment 129
      0:06:48.200000 ---> 0:06:51.160000
      compete against each other every day to get a vote.
   Segment 130
      0:06:51.160000 ---> 0:06:53.080000
      It's basically a startup directories,
   Segment 131
      0:06:53.080000 ---> 0:06:55.640000
      except it got millions of visitors per month,
   Segment 132
      0:06:55.640000 ---> 0:06:59.320000
      and lots of journalists go there to write articles about new tech products.
   Segment 133
      0:06:59.320000 ---> 0:07:03.800000
      It's a great way to bring a bit of revenue and boost the morale on the short term,
   Segment 134
      0:07:03.800000 ---> 0:07:06.920000
      which in return, helps you walk on the project for the long term.
   Segment 135
      0:07:06.920000 ---> 0:07:10.200000
      So I listed my startup on product hand, got lots of a vote,
   Segment 136
      0:07:10.200000 ---> 0:07:13.560000
      even a product of the day award, and got lots of traffic from that.
   Segment 137
      0:07:13.560000 ---> 0:07:15.800000
      And thanks to the media coverage after the launch,
   Segment 138
      0:07:15.800000 ---> 0:07:22.920000
      the app quickly grow to 1500 of monthly recurring subscriptions.
   Segment 139
      0:07:24.040000 ---> 0:07:26.520000
      Since I know had some predictable revenue,
   Segment 140
      0:07:26.520000 ---> 0:07:30.920000
      I decided to start ads, and even if the results were not incredible at first,
   Segment 141
      0:07:30.920000 ---> 0:07:33.240000
      I still managed to get too few sales every day.
   Segment 142
      0:07:33.240000 ---> 0:07:34.360000
      The hardest was done.
   Segment 143
      0:07:34.360000 ---> 0:07:37.480000
      My startup was generating consistent revenue every month,
   Segment 144
      0:07:37.480000 ---> 0:07:39.480000
      and I could not try to scale it.
   Segment 145
      0:07:39.480000 ---> 0:07:42.840000
      Now, growing a startup is a lot of trial and error.
   Segment 146
      0:07:42.840000 ---> 0:07:46.360000
      You need to try things, see what works, and do more of that.
   Segment 147
      0:07:46.360000 ---> 0:07:50.120000
      But that takes lots of fork and energy, so I needed to focus.
   Segment 148
      0:07:50.120000 ---> 0:07:52.040000
      And I had the perfect solution for that.
   Segment 149
      0:07:52.120000 ---> 0:07:56.760000
      In May 2022, I locked myself in a hotel room for two months to learn how to code.
   Segment 150
      0:07:56.760000 ---> 0:07:58.680000
      This is what I call monk mode.
   Segment 151
      0:07:58.680000 ---> 0:08:00.280000
      The principle is simple.
   Segment 152
      0:08:00.280000 ---> 0:08:03.560000
      Find a place comfortable enough so you can stay inside for weeks,
   Segment 153
      0:08:03.560000 ---> 0:08:07.240000
      organize your routine so you don't waste any time, and grind all day.
   Segment 154
      0:08:07.240000 ---> 0:08:09.480000
      It's simple, but it worked for me.
   Segment 155
      0:08:09.480000 ---> 0:08:13.720000
      I went from zero to be able to code fully working website in just two months.
   Segment 156
      0:08:13.720000 ---> 0:08:15.720000
      So it was time to do that again.
   Segment 157
      0:08:15.720000 ---> 0:08:20.040000
      I found a nice apartment, took from my savings, and paid six months upfront,
   Segment 158
      0:08:20.040000 ---> 0:08:21.720000
      and then prepared for the grind.
   Segment 159
      0:08:25.160000 ---> 0:08:30.040000
      So right now, my app is making 3,000 monthly recurring revenue,
   Segment 160
      0:08:30.040000 ---> 0:08:31.880000
      but I think I can do better than that.
   Segment 161
      0:08:32.440000 ---> 0:08:37.880000
      I think I can push my app to 5,000 to 10,000 monthly recurring revenue
   Segment 162
      0:08:37.880000 ---> 0:08:40.520000
      before selling it for way better price.
   Segment 163
      0:08:42.040000 ---> 0:08:47.960000
      So yeah, that's basically what I'm going to try to achieve during those six months.
   Segment 164
      0:08:47.960000 ---> 0:08:51
      So I will do everything I can to grow my app.
   Segment 165
      0:08:52.760000 ---> 0:08:53.960000
      Doesn't matter what it takes.
   Segment 166
      0:08:54.520000 ---> 0:08:55.560000
      I'm just here.
   Segment 167
      0:08:55.560000 ---> 0:08:59.560000
      I don't have anything else, just pure focus.
   Segment 168
      0:08:59.560000 ---> 0:09:02.600000
      My girlfriend just left back to the US.
   Segment 169
      0:09:02.600000 ---> 0:09:06.680000
      So we're going to spend a long distance for some time.
   Segment 170
      0:09:07.560000 ---> 0:09:09.400000
      So it's just me and my laptop.
   Segment 171
      0:09:09.960000 ---> 0:09:11.800000
      The place I found had a gym in the building,
   Segment 172
      0:09:11.800000 ---> 0:09:14.600000
      and I found a healthy meal service delivery nearby.
   Segment 173
      0:09:14.600000 ---> 0:09:18.120000
      With this system in place, I could optimize my routines to the extreme
   Segment 174
      0:09:18.120000 ---> 0:09:19.320000
      and never leave my building.
   Segment 175
      0:09:19.960000 ---> 0:09:21.400000
      Which is exactly what I needed.
   Segment 176
      0:09:21.400000 ---> 0:09:23.720000
      At first, it was hard to choose what to focus on
   Segment 177
      0:09:23.720000 ---> 0:09:25.720000
      because there was just so many things to do.
   Segment 178
      0:09:25.720000 ---> 0:09:29
      But after testing a few things, I finally found a trick
   Segment 179
      0:09:29 ---> 0:09:30.760000
      that allowed me to double my revenues.
   Segment 180
      0:09:32.200000 ---> 0:09:33.160000
      Imagine this.
   Segment 181
      0:09:33.160000 ---> 0:09:36.200000
      You have an online store that sells pet supplies.
   Segment 182
      0:09:36.200000 ---> 0:09:39.400000
      Now, you want to run ads to attract new customers.
   Segment 183
      0:09:39.400000 ---> 0:09:40.520000
      What's the best move?
   Segment 184
      0:09:40.520000 ---> 0:09:44.360000
      Instead of making generic ads, focus on a specific customer group.
   Segment 185
      0:09:44.360000 ---> 0:09:48.200000
      For example, create an ad specifically for corgi owners.
   Segment 186
      0:09:48.200000 ---> 0:09:51.960000
      You will reach less people, but you can be sure that a corgi owner
   Segment 187
      0:09:51.960000 ---> 0:09:55.560000
      seeing an ad asking, are you a corgi owner will read it?
   Segment 188
      0:09:55.560000 ---> 0:09:59.080000
      Simply because it's made specifically for them and it's not generic.
   Segment 189
      0:09:59.080000 ---> 0:10:00.760000
      Which will generate more sales?
   Segment 190
      0:10:00.760000 ---> 0:10:02.280000
      Quality over quantity.
   Segment 191
      0:10:02.280000 ---> 0:10:04.360000
      So I decided to do that for my startup
   Segment 192
      0:10:04.360000 ---> 0:10:07.960000
      and started making ads and landing pages for specific audiences.
   Segment 193
      0:10:07.960000 ---> 0:10:12.520000
      And after a few weeks of testing, my website started to generate more revenues.
   Segment 194
      0:10:12.520000 ---> 0:10:13.640000
      Way more revenues.
   Segment 195
      0:10:13.640000 ---> 0:10:16.200000
      Between the revenue made for the monthly subscriptions
   Segment 196
      0:10:16.200000 ---> 0:10:18.280000
      and users who paid one year upfront,
   Segment 197
      0:10:18.280000 ---> 0:10:21.880000
      I started to generate over $10,000 of sales per month.
   Segment 198
      0:10:21.880000 ---> 0:10:25.160000
      I even allowed myself to take a small break in Korea to meet friends.
   Segment 199
      0:10:25.160000 ---> 0:10:29.160000
      Everything was great, but have you ever heard of Murphy's law?
   Segment 200
      0:10:30.600000 ---> 0:10:34.760000
      Everything that can go wrong will go wrong and at the worst possible time.
   Segment 201
      0:10:39.160000 ---> 0:10:41.720000
      On April 16, in the middle of the night,
   Segment 202
      0:10:41.720000 ---> 0:10:45.320000
      a bug happened on my website and made it completely unisable.
   Segment 203
      0:10:45.320000 ---> 0:10:47.240000
      And when I woke up...
   Segment 204
      0:10:47.240000 ---> 0:10:55.160000
      Yeah, I woke up so that the sales were completely down 70%
   Segment 205
      0:10:55.160000 ---> 0:10:59.720000
      because all the fucking bug got sleep last night.
   Segment 206
      0:11:00.680000 ---> 0:11:05.880000
      When I was asleep and then I had to use another issue and then another one and another one.
   Segment 207
      0:11:05.880000 ---> 0:11:07.880000
      It just...
   Segment 208
      0:11:07.880000 ---> 0:11:12.200000
      The other fucking stopped the whole fucking day.
   Segment 209
      0:11:12.200000 ---> 0:11:16.920000
      I spent seven hours straight trying to fix one bug and I could...
   Segment 210
      0:11:16.920000 ---> 0:11:17.880000
      I just could not...
   Segment 211
      0:11:17.880000 ---> 0:11:19.320000
      It was not working.
   Segment 212
      0:11:19.320000 ---> 0:11:21.240000
      I don't want to deal with that shit anymore.
   Segment 213
      0:11:21.800000 ---> 0:11:25.160000
      I received over 50 emails from customer complaining.
   Segment 214
      0:11:25.160000 ---> 0:11:29.880000
      Sales were done 70% and people started to cancel subscriptions.
   Segment 215
      0:11:29.880000 ---> 0:11:33.160000
      It lasted for two days before I was able to fix it,
   Segment 216
      0:11:33.160000 ---> 0:11:35.400000
      during which I barely got any sleep.
   Segment 217
      0:11:35.480000 ---> 0:11:39.400000
      But when I tried to get back to work, something was wrong.
   Segment 218
      0:11:39.400000 ---> 0:11:41.560000
      It's like my motivation was drained.
   Segment 219
      0:11:41.560000 ---> 0:11:43.080000
      I couldn't do anything at all.
   Segment 220
      0:11:43.080000 ---> 0:11:47.800000
      So I waited a few more days and waited until I realized...
   Segment 221
      0:11:47.800000 ---> 0:11:50.760000
      I just cannot work anymore.
   Segment 222
      0:11:52.200000 ---> 0:11:55
      Way too burned out, I guess.
   Segment 223
      0:11:56.840000 ---> 0:12:00.600000
      Like I can work 20 minutes and then I just...
   Segment 224
      0:12:00.600000 ---> 0:12:01.160000
      I cannot.
   Segment 225
      0:12:01.160000 ---> 0:12:02.600000
      It's just too hard.
   Segment 226
      0:12:02.600000 ---> 0:12:04.120000
      I cannot focus and stuff.
   Segment 227
      0:12:05.560000 ---> 0:12:08.360000
      It would take much longer to recover from that
   Segment 228
      0:12:08.360000 ---> 0:12:10.680000
      and be able to walk on this project again.
   Segment 229
      0:12:10.680000 ---> 0:12:11.560000
      If ever.
   Segment 230
      0:12:11.560000 ---> 0:12:14.840000
      But not working on it for months was not an option.
   Segment 231
      0:12:14.840000 ---> 0:12:18.760000
      The AI space moved incredibly fast and in just one month,
   Segment 232
      0:12:18.760000 ---> 0:12:21.160000
      you can become completely irrelevant.
   Segment 233
      0:12:21.160000 ---> 0:12:25.560000
      So the two solutions were to either hire someone to manage a website for me
   Segment 234
      0:12:26.120000 ---> 0:12:27.320000
      or to sell it.
   Segment 235
      0:12:27.320000 ---> 0:12:30.120000
      Hiring someone would allow me to take time off,
   Segment 236
      0:12:30.120000 ---> 0:12:35.240000
      but finding the right person would be another headache I didn't want to deal with.
   Segment 237
      0:12:35.240000 ---> 0:12:36.920000
      So there was only one option.
   Segment 238
      0:12:37.560000 ---> 0:12:38.360000
      To sell it.
   Segment 239
      0:12:38.360000 ---> 0:12:43
      From my calculations, my startup could be worth up to $300,000.
   Segment 240
      0:12:43 ---> 0:12:45.560000
      But that was an obvious problem.
   Segment 241
      0:12:50.200000 ---> 0:12:51.880000
      I didn't had 6 to 10 months.
   Segment 242
      0:12:51.880000 ---> 0:12:55.640000
      Due to the burnouts, working on this project was not an option.
   Segment 243
      0:12:55.640000 ---> 0:12:59.080000
      And if I waited, it would eventually stop growing and lose its value.
   Segment 244
      0:12:59.080000 ---> 0:13:00.520000
      So conclusion was simple.
   Segment 245
      0:13:00.520000 ---> 0:13:04.360000
      I had to sell in the next few weeks or I could be left with nothing.
   Segment 246
      0:13:05.240000 ---> 0:13:10.840000
      I got on a call with a bunny from my choir,
   Segment 247
      0:13:10.840000 ---> 0:13:14.280000
      which gives me tips to get the best outcome considering my situation.
   Segment 248
      0:13:14.280000 ---> 0:13:17.240000
      So I decided to price my startup at $200,000
   Segment 249
      0:13:17.240000 ---> 0:13:21.880000
      to make sure it would be a good deal for the buyer to get full cash and to sell it fast.
   Segment 250
      0:13:21.880000 ---> 0:13:25.240000
      I quickly got my first formal offer for $200,000
   Segment 251
      0:13:25.240000 ---> 0:13:28.520000
      and the buyer was fine to pay cash and in the next few weeks.
   Segment 252
      0:13:28.520000 ---> 0:13:30.520000
      And after a few weeks of waiting,
   Segment 253
      0:13:30.520000 ---> 0:13:34.520000
      I received the asset purchase agreement called APA.
   Segment 254
      0:13:34.520000 ---> 0:13:39.640000
      So this is the purchase asset purchase agreement,
   Segment 255
      0:13:40.520000 ---> 0:13:47.160000
      which means once this is signed, the sale is done and is not just about transferring the actual things.
   Segment 256
      0:13:48.200000 ---> 0:13:50.040000
      I don't know what to say, I'm just really excited.
   Segment 257
      0:13:52.200000 ---> 0:13:53.720000
      Okay, this is done.
   Segment 258
      0:13:54.840000 ---> 0:13:57.720000
      And just like that, my startup was officially sold.
   Segment 259
      0:13:57.720000 ---> 0:13:59.080000
      But it wasn't over.
   Segment 260
      0:13:59.080000 ---> 0:14:01.480000
      We might have signed a piece of virtual paper,
   Segment 261
      0:14:01.560000 ---> 0:14:05.960000
      but I still had to transfer everything and receive the $200,000.
   Segment 262
      0:14:05.960000 ---> 0:14:08.680000
      Now to make sure everything would be transferred safely,
   Segment 263
      0:14:08.680000 ---> 0:14:11.720000
      we decided to use a middleman, escrow.com.
   Segment 264
      0:14:11.720000 ---> 0:14:15.240000
      And as you are able to see, things would go terribly wrong.
   Segment 265
      0:14:15.240000 ---> 0:14:20.200000
      So the buyers and the money to the middleman to escrow.
   Segment 266
      0:14:20.200000 ---> 0:14:22.600000
      So now it's just about we transfer everything.
   Segment 267
      0:14:22.600000 ---> 0:14:28.360000
      So I'm going to transfer the domain name, everything but the clicks,
   Segment 268
      0:14:28.360000 ---> 0:14:29.880000
      which should be tomorrow.
   Segment 269
      0:14:30.840000 ---> 0:14:32.840000
      And after that, the transaction is complete.
   Segment 270
      0:14:35.080000 ---> 0:14:37.640000
      And I get my money.
   Segment 271
      0:14:37.640000 ---> 0:14:38.680000
      So this is great.
   Segment 272
      0:14:40.440000 ---> 0:14:47.400000
      It's 10 pm and I just received the message from the middleman,
   Segment 273
      0:14:47.400000 ---> 0:14:52.200000
      escrow, who just said that they did not want to send me the money.
   Segment 274
      0:14:52.200000 ---> 0:14:59.640000
      Because I use WISE, but obviously WISE is literally under options.
   Segment 275
      0:14:59.640000 ---> 0:15:03.080000
      Like it's literally said, yeah, you can receive your money from WISE.
   Segment 276
      0:15:04.520000 ---> 0:15:08.120000
      I'm not sure if everything is going to have to be cancelled.
   Segment 277
      0:15:08.120000 ---> 0:15:09.480000
      I don't know how it could work.
   Segment 278
      0:15:10.040000 ---> 0:15:12.120000
      Because the buyer can only do the transfer tomorrow.
   Segment 279
      0:15:12.120000 ---> 0:15:14.440000
      After that, he won't be available for like a long time.
   Segment 280
      0:15:14.440000 ---> 0:15:15.640000
      This is fucking bullshit.
   Segment 281
      0:15:15.640000 ---> 0:15:19.320000
      Like I literally used WISE last time using them.
   Segment 282
      0:15:19.320000 ---> 0:15:24.840000
      So I don't know if they're lying or whatever, but they just don't want to send me the money.
   Segment 283
      0:15:30.040000 ---> 0:15:33.640000
      Apparently it's because I only had the WISE account for this company
   Segment 284
      0:15:33.640000 ---> 0:15:34.840000
      and they don't accept WISE.
   Segment 285
      0:15:35.400000 ---> 0:15:39.800000
      But their website clearly says they accept WISE.
   Segment 286
      0:15:39.800000 ---> 0:15:42.120000
      So I'm not really sure what happened.
   Segment 287
      0:15:42.120000 ---> 0:15:45.880000
      Opening a new bank account could take month, so this was out of the equation.
   Segment 288
      0:15:45.960000 ---> 0:15:53
      And after trying to negotiate with them and threaten them, it was clear we had to cancel everything and restart from scratch.
   Segment 289
      0:15:53 ---> 0:15:57.640000
      This would take at least a few more weeks for the buyer to get refunded and could potentially
   Segment 290
      0:15:57.640000 ---> 0:16:00.280000
      ruin the whole thing if the buyer just ran out of patience.
   Segment 291
      0:16:01.480000 ---> 0:16:05.080000
      Luckily for me, the buyer still wanted to continue the acquisition.
   Segment 292
      0:16:05.080000 ---> 0:16:08.840000
      This time, instead of using a middleman, we would do everything manually.
   Segment 293
      0:16:08.840000 ---> 0:16:14.040000
      But even if I trusted the buyer, there was still a risk he would not send me the money after I transferred everything.
   Segment 294
      0:16:14.840000 ---> 0:16:17.560000
      But I had no choice, so I did it in a way.
   Segment 295
      0:16:18.120000 ---> 0:16:25.160000
      The only thing left now was for the buyer to get refunded by the middleman and then get my $200,000 after transferring everything.
   Segment 296
      0:16:25.160000 ---> 0:16:30.040000
      But as you can probably guess by the time left in this video, it didn't work as planned.
   Segment 297
      0:16:32.840000 ---> 0:16:42.040000
      Hey, so it's been a week now waiting for the refund from the middleman escrow.
   Segment 298
      0:16:44.760000 ---> 0:16:47.400000
      It's just more and more waiting.
   Segment 299
      0:16:47.400000 ---> 0:16:51.560000
      Like honestly, like mentally, I feel depressed as fuck.
   Segment 300
      0:16:53 ---> 0:16:57.560000
      I probably said that like 20 times already, but yeah, the waiting is fucking killing me.
   Segment 301
      0:16:57.560000 ---> 0:16:58.440000
      I just hate that.
   Segment 302
      0:16:58.440000 ---> 0:17:05.640000
      I'm not going to say, you know, it's hard because it's not like I was working in a factory or, you know, some like manual work,
   Segment 303
      0:17:05.640000 ---> 0:17:07.640000
      but it just pissed me off.
   Segment 304
      0:17:07.640000 ---> 0:17:09.320000
      It just really fucking pissed me off.
   Segment 305
      0:17:09.320000 ---> 0:17:14.440000
      But early the buyers received the refund back.
   Segment 306
      0:17:15.160000 ---> 0:17:21.640000
      So it means that like early next week, we should be able to file everything.
   Segment 307
      0:17:22.760000 ---> 0:17:26.360000
      Turns out escrow lied about the refund.
   Segment 308
      0:17:27.640000 ---> 0:17:31.400000
      So the money never reached my buyer's bank account.
   Segment 309
      0:17:31.400000 ---> 0:17:34.280000
      The light, they said it was processed.
   Segment 310
      0:17:35.080000 ---> 0:17:39.800000
      But no, it's not my buyer contacted his bank.
   Segment 311
      0:17:39.800000 ---> 0:17:42.200000
      The bank said, no, we didn't receive anything.
   Segment 312
      0:17:42.200000 ---> 0:17:43.880000
      So they are fucking lying.
   Segment 313
      0:17:43.880000 ---> 0:17:49.320000
      And after contacting them and threatening them for almost two weeks, we had the refund done.
   Segment 314
      0:17:49.320000 ---> 0:17:50.760000
      No, the buyer had the money back.
   Segment 315
      0:17:50.760000 ---> 0:17:52.680000
      It was time to transfer everything.
   Segment 316
      0:17:52.680000 ---> 0:17:55.160000
      And again, things started to go wrong.
   Segment 317
      0:17:55.160000 ---> 0:17:58.120000
      So yeah, we need to find a way to transfer stripe.
   Segment 318
      0:17:58.120000 ---> 0:18:02.680000
      And of course, the support has absolutely no fucking clue how to do it.
   Segment 319
      0:18:02.680000 ---> 0:18:08.760000
      And we call them, the person was like, oh, yeah, I don't know how that works.
   Segment 320
      0:18:08.760000 ---> 0:18:10.200000
      So that's great.
   Segment 321
      0:18:11.320000 ---> 0:18:14.920000
      So we need a special team, which obviously take a week to insert.
   Segment 322
      0:18:14.920000 ---> 0:18:19.640000
      The most critical part of the transfer was stripe, the platform to handle monthly subscriptions.
   Segment 323
      0:18:19.640000 ---> 0:18:24.040000
      But there was no easy way to transfer subscriptions from an account to the other.
   Segment 324
      0:18:24.040000 ---> 0:18:25.640000
      So we would have to deal more.
   Segment 325
      0:18:25.640000 ---> 0:18:29.080000
      But luckily, the buyer found a startup that could do it.
   Segment 326
      0:18:29.080000 ---> 0:18:33.400000
      It costed him $3,000 for one hour for it from them, but it worked.
   Segment 327
      0:18:33.400000 ---> 0:18:37.320000
      And it saved us day of manual work, so it was worth it at the end.
   Segment 328
      0:18:37.320000 ---> 0:18:43.080000
      With the transfer done, the only thing left was to receive my $200,000 on my bank account.
   Segment 329
      0:18:43.080000 ---> 0:18:44.040000
      And guess what?
   Segment 330
      0:18:46.360000 ---> 0:18:46.840000
      All right.
   Segment 331
      0:18:48.440000 ---> 0:18:48.920000
      All right.
   Segment 332
      0:18:48.920000 ---> 0:18:53.800000
      So finally, I officially sold my app for $200,000.
   Segment 333
      0:18:53.800000 ---> 0:18:55.160000
      I got the money on my account.
   Segment 334
      0:18:55.960000 ---> 0:19:00.600000
      So yeah, I hope you will be able to see it, but you have $200,000, minus some of the bank fee.
   Segment 335
      0:19:01.800000 ---> 0:19:03
      The money just came in.
   Segment 336
      0:19:03 ---> 0:19:06.680000
      I was going to bed like right before I was, okay, I'm going to just turn off the light,
   Segment 337
      0:19:06.680000 ---> 0:19:07.240000
      go to sleep.
   Segment 338
      0:19:07.240000 ---> 0:19:09.720000
      I just checked, I refreshed and the money was back.
   Segment 339
      0:19:09.720000 ---> 0:19:10.360000
      It was here.
   Segment 340
      0:19:10.360000 ---> 0:19:13.960000
      So oh my god, that's fucking surrealistic.
   Segment 341
      0:19:16.440000 ---> 0:19:16.840000
      I don't know.
   Segment 342
      0:19:16.840000 ---> 0:19:21.160000
      I'm not really good at expressing stuff, but I'm really fucking happy.
   Segment 343
      0:19:22.120000 ---> 0:19:24.680000
      I can retire in Asia if I wanted to.
   Segment 344
      0:19:24.680000 ---> 0:19:30.520000
      Like I can live in Bali or in Thailand or anywhere, like forever, basically.
   Segment 345
      0:19:31.240000 ---> 0:19:35.800000
      Of course, there will be some taxes and stuff like that, but they are not still super high
   Segment 346
      0:19:35.800000 ---> 0:19:37
      compared to what I'm used to.
   Segment 347
      0:19:38.440000 ---> 0:19:40.520000
      Oh, fucking hell, this is insane.
   Segment 348
      0:19:43.960000 ---> 0:19:44.280000
      Yeah.
   Segment 349
      0:19:46.200000 ---> 0:19:47.560000
      Actually, I don't know what to say.
   Segment 350
      0:19:48.280000 ---> 0:19:49.720000
      I'm just really happy.
   Segment 351
      0:19:49.720000 ---> 0:19:51.880000
      I'm really happy that this is finally done.
   Segment 352
      0:19:51.880000 ---> 0:19:53.400000
      I'm really happy that I can move on.
   Segment 353
      0:19:54.280000 ---> 0:19:57.240000
      With this acquisition, plus the sales I made from my other projects,
   Segment 354
      0:19:57.240000 ---> 0:20:02.840000
      I now have around $300,000 in my bank account, which is 30% of being a millionaire.
   Segment 355
      0:20:02.840000 ---> 0:20:03.400000
      Nice.
   Segment 356
      0:20:03.400000 ---> 0:20:07.880000
      I might still be burned out, but at least I have a shit lot of money on my bank account now.
   Segment 357
      0:20:07.880000 ---> 0:20:11.960000
      That is before coming back to work because I just sold my main source of income again.
   Segment 358
      0:20:11.960000 ---> 0:20:15.320000
      But spoilers, I already have a new startup that generates revenue already.
   Segment 359
      0:20:15.400000 ---> 0:20:18.200000
      And this is because I have a good process to find new startup ideas.
   Segment 360
      0:20:18.200000 ---> 0:20:21
      And if you want to know how, watch this video.

Transcription for Revealing Everything About My 2 $500_Month SaaS Side Hustles (Marketing,  Tech Stack, Costs, etc.).mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:04.160000
      I've built two SaaS apps to $500 a month of recurring revenue and in this video
   Segment 2
      0:00:04.160000 ---> 0:00:10.980000
      I'm gonna be pulling back the curtains on both of them to show everything about how I grew the app showing you real striped revenue numbers as well as other
   Segment 3
      0:00:10.980000 ---> 0:00:17.180000
      important metrics like number of users retention costs so you can see how much profit I'm making not just pure revenue
   Segment 4
      0:00:17.180000 ---> 0:00:23.760000
      I'm basically gonna be showing you my entire secret sauce of how I built everything and how I monetized everything and how I grew everything
   Segment 5
      0:00:23.760000 ---> 0:00:28.700000
      So let's get started fair warning the vast majority of this video is gonna be just scream recording of me
   Segment 6
      0:00:28.700000 ---> 0:00:32.460000
      Infally dumping a ton of information so get ready. It's gonna be super dense
   Segment 7
      0:00:32.460000 ---> 0:00:35.460000
      But hopefully you find some helpful information in there. All right
   Segment 8
      0:00:35.460000 ---> 0:00:39
      So let's get started with the very first SaaS product that I built which is called a Nexus
   Segment 9
      0:00:39.060000 ---> 0:00:43.460000
      Researcher.ai so the very first app that I built is an app called nexus research.ai
   Segment 10
      0:00:43.460000 ---> 0:00:48.060000
      Which you can see right here and it's essentially an AI powered reading and note-taking tool
   Segment 11
      0:00:48.060000 ---> 0:00:50.100000
      This was a very common tool that's out there
   Segment 12
      0:00:50.100000 ---> 0:00:55.500000
      It's one of those chat PDF tools where you essentially upload a PDF and then from that upload a PDF
   Segment 13
      0:00:55.500000 ---> 0:00:58.620000
      You can then chat with it to extract any information that you want
   Segment 14
      0:00:58.700000 ---> 0:01:02.380000
      Now I'll be the first to say this is not the first product to come out in this space
   Segment 15
      0:01:02.380000 ---> 0:01:06.700000
      I shamelessly copied or got inspiration from I stole like an artist
   Segment 16
      0:01:06.700000 ---> 0:01:11.420000
      Basically, I saw that this tool has proven market demand where people were building
   Segment 17
      0:01:11.580000 ---> 0:01:14.500000
      Companies off of it and making a ton of money off of this type of idea
   Segment 18
      0:01:14.500000 ---> 0:01:17.700000
      So I just leaned into it and made some tiny differences from it
   Segment 19
      0:01:17.700000 ---> 0:01:20.300000
      And I basically made the idea my own idea
   Segment 20
      0:01:20.300000 ---> 0:01:24.900000
      So I talked about this in my previous video where when you are trying to build one of your very first SaaS products
   Segment 21
      0:01:24.900000 ---> 0:01:28.540000
      Do not be afraid to copy other existing ideas that have been proven to work
   Segment 22
      0:01:28.540000 ---> 0:01:30.820000
      You want some type of market validation out there
   Segment 23
      0:01:30.820000 ---> 0:01:32.340000
      So it's a very straightforward product
   Segment 24
      0:01:32.340000 ---> 0:01:36.500000
      And what makes this a little bit different is the fact that you can chat with multiple papers at once
   Segment 25
      0:01:36.500000 ---> 0:01:37.620000
      You can see right here
   Segment 26
      0:01:37.620000 ---> 0:01:41.460000
      You can ask one question to multiple papers to extract all the information out there
   Segment 27
      0:01:41.460000 ---> 0:01:42.780000
      This is a little bit more unique
   Segment 28
      0:01:42.780000 ---> 0:01:45.460000
      This is my own twist to the whole PDF reader
   Segment 29
      0:01:45.460000 ---> 0:01:52.020000
      AI PDF reader idea and then you can also take notes at the same time while you're reading a certain piece of paper as well
   Segment 30
      0:01:52.020000 ---> 0:01:57.540000
      So those are some other smaller twists to this original idea of a chat PDF AI application
   Segment 31
      0:01:57.540000 ---> 0:02:01.060000
      But then adopting it as my own and putting some small twists to it
   Segment 32
      0:02:01.060000 ---> 0:02:05.140000
      So now if we go over to let's go to our stripe dashboard
   Segment 33
      0:02:05.140000 ---> 0:02:09.300000
      You can see that this is the Nexus app and you can see that currently I'm at around
   Segment 34
      0:02:10.100000 ---> 0:02:12.100000
      $450 of monthly recurring revenue
   Segment 35
      0:02:12.100000 ---> 0:02:16.420000
      But what's even crazier if you go to where I'm hosting this website, which is versatile.com
   Segment 36
      0:02:16.500000 ---> 0:02:19.900000
      You can see I literally have not touched this app in forever
   Segment 37
      0:02:20.140000 ---> 0:02:23.660000
      So this it says 24 days ago was the last time that I touched this app
   Segment 38
      0:02:23.660000 ---> 0:02:27.980000
      But really I was just redeploying this application to get a new environment variable out there
   Segment 39
      0:02:27.980000 ---> 0:02:31.500000
      So really I actually haven't touched this app in 70 days
   Segment 40
      0:02:31.500000 ---> 0:02:33.980000
      It has been so long and it kind of just prints money for me
   Segment 41
      0:02:33.980000 ---> 0:02:35.260000
      It's actually insane
   Segment 42
      0:02:35.260000 ---> 0:02:40.060000
      So if you go look at the revenue you can say I'm at around $450 a month of recurring revenue
   Segment 43
      0:02:40.060000 ---> 0:02:41.260000
      And in this year to date
   Segment 44
      0:02:41.260000 ---> 0:02:45.340000
      Which is pretty much the entire existence of this company of this product
   Segment 45
      0:02:45.340000 ---> 0:02:48.940000
      It has made roughly $2,600 total
   Segment 46
      0:02:49.020000 ---> 0:02:52.540000
      So not life-changing money not enough to like retire me by any means
   Segment 47
      0:02:52.540000 ---> 0:02:58.140000
      But I'm not going to complain at a free $449 that come into my pocket every single month
   Segment 48
      0:02:58.140000 ---> 0:03:00.460000
      So in terms of how I built this application
   Segment 49
      0:03:00.460000 ---> 0:03:03.500000
      This is a next-jess application that is hosted on Versailles
   Segment 50
      0:03:03.500000 ---> 0:03:04.540000
      Like I showed here
   Segment 51
      0:03:04.540000 ---> 0:03:07.980000
      I'm using next-jess as my entire stack front and end the back end
   Segment 52
      0:03:07.980000 ---> 0:03:10.140000
      I'm using stripe as my payment processor
   Segment 53
      0:03:10.140000 ---> 0:03:14.940000
      I actually have an existing video where I talk about my entire stack of what I use to build my applications
   Segment 54
      0:03:14.940000 ---> 0:03:16.460000
      And this is exactly that
   Segment 55
      0:03:16.540000 ---> 0:03:19.340000
      It is using the same exact tech stack that I talked about in that video
   Segment 56
      0:03:19.340000 ---> 0:03:21.980000
      So it uses PlanetScale as my database in the back end
   Segment 57
      0:03:21.980000 ---> 0:03:24.540000
      Make sure to watch that video for more details if you're interested
   Segment 58
      0:03:24.540000 ---> 0:03:27.020000
      And then in terms of how I grew this application
   Segment 59
      0:03:27.020000 ---> 0:03:31.100000
      Let's go over to Instagram because it was 100% social media marketing
   Segment 60
      0:03:31.100000 ---> 0:03:32.540000
      So we go over here
   Segment 61
      0:03:32.540000 ---> 0:03:33.260000
      Let's go to
   Segment 62
      0:03:34.860000 ---> 0:03:35.260000
      Come on
   Segment 63
      0:03:38.620000 ---> 0:03:42.940000
      It was 100% social media marketing in terms of how I grew this application
   Segment 64
      0:03:43.020000 ---> 0:03:44.620000
      And if you go over to the Reels
   Segment 65
      0:03:44.620000 ---> 0:03:47.340000
      You can see it's kind of a big account 4,000 followers
   Segment 66
      0:03:47.340000 ---> 0:03:49.500000
      But better than this is a pure follower number
   Segment 67
      0:03:49.500000 ---> 0:03:52.220000
      It's actually the number of impressions that I got
   Segment 68
      0:03:52.220000 ---> 0:03:55.100000
      So there were actually two main video series that I used
   Segment 69
      0:03:55.100000 ---> 0:03:58.300000
      To grow the social media account and get impressions about my product
   Segment 70
      0:03:58.300000 ---> 0:03:59.900000
      So the first series was this one
   Segment 71
      0:03:59.900000 ---> 0:04:01.260000
      If colleges were honest
   Segment 72
      0:04:01.260000 ---> 0:04:04.620000
      So I talked about all the big colleges, Caltech, Stanford, MIT
   Segment 73
      0:04:04.620000 ---> 0:04:06.700000
      What else? Upen, Columbia, Princeton
   Segment 74
      0:04:06.700000 ---> 0:04:09.500000
      All the big name elite prestigious schools
   Segment 75
      0:04:09.500000 ---> 0:04:11.660000
      Now I knew that this was going to go viral
   Segment 76
      0:04:11.660000 ---> 0:04:15.660000
      Because for college students college is such a huge portion of their identity
   Segment 77
      0:04:15.660000 ---> 0:04:18.300000
      And this whole series of if something were honest
   Segment 78
      0:04:18.300000 ---> 0:04:21.740000
      This has been done for ages and years and years on social media
   Segment 79
      0:04:21.740000 ---> 0:04:23.020000
      And on YouTube and all of that
   Segment 80
      0:04:23.020000 ---> 0:04:24.620000
      So I knew that this is a proven format
   Segment 81
      0:04:24.620000 ---> 0:04:27.980000
      And because college is such a strong identity for the students that are attending there
   Segment 82
      0:04:27.980000 ---> 0:04:31.420000
      They want to see like oh how is this person going to roast my school
   Segment 83
      0:04:31.420000 ---> 0:04:33.500000
      I knew that it was going to invoke some type of reaction
   Segment 84
      0:04:33.500000 ---> 0:04:34.780000
      Both positive and negative
   Segment 85
      0:04:34.780000 ---> 0:04:35.820000
      But you know nope
   Segment 86
      0:04:35.820000 ---> 0:04:37.260000
      No such thing as bad press
   Segment 87
      0:04:37.260000 ---> 0:04:38.460000
      All press is good press
   Segment 88
      0:04:38.460000 ---> 0:04:41.580000
      So that was the one video series that kind of first blew me up
   Segment 89
      0:04:41.580000 ---> 0:04:45.100000
      But the one downside to this series was that it did not show the product at all
   Segment 90
      0:04:45.100000 ---> 0:04:47.180000
      It didn't talk about the product at all
   Segment 91
      0:04:47.180000 ---> 0:04:49.900000
      But it was still useful because it got a lot of eyeballs to my account
   Segment 92
      0:04:49.900000 ---> 0:04:53.500000
      And it helped grow my account to a certain minimum number of followers
   Segment 93
      0:04:53.500000 ---> 0:04:59.100000
      So then from there the second series that I used to more organically show the product
   Segment 94
      0:04:59.100000 ---> 0:05:01.020000
      Was this series right here
   Segment 95
      0:05:01.020000 ---> 0:05:02.860000
      It will put it on mute in the background
   Segment 96
      0:05:02.860000 ---> 0:05:07.020000
      So essentially what I did was I would find a really interesting article or headline
   Segment 97
      0:05:07.020000 ---> 0:05:10.140000
      And then I would use my tool Nexus Research.ai
   Segment 98
      0:05:10.140000 ---> 0:05:12.460000
      To summarize the entire text of that
   Segment 99
      0:05:12.460000 ---> 0:05:16.220000
      So in every single video I say hey I'm too lazy to read this entire article
   Segment 100
      0:05:16.220000 ---> 0:05:18.460000
      So I'm going to be using Nexus Research.ai
   Segment 101
      0:05:18.460000 ---> 0:05:21.100000
      To summarize everything and get all the information out there
   Segment 102
      0:05:21.100000 ---> 0:05:24.540000
      Now as you can see this is an infinitely reproducible format
   Segment 103
      0:05:24.540000 ---> 0:05:26.780000
      Because there is so much interesting articles out there
   Segment 104
      0:05:26.780000 ---> 0:05:29.500000
      So many different interesting pieces of text
   Segment 105
      0:05:29.500000 ---> 0:05:32.300000
      That I can summarize and explain to the people of the internet
   Segment 106
      0:05:32.300000 ---> 0:05:34.220000
      But you can also see that you know
   Segment 107
      0:05:34.220000 ---> 0:05:37.020000
      They will not always go as viral as the other videos
   Segment 108
      0:05:37.020000 ---> 0:05:38.860000
      So you can see this one only got 7,000 views
   Segment 109
      0:05:38.940000 ---> 0:05:40.540000
      This one got 13,000 views
   Segment 110
      0:05:40.540000 ---> 0:05:41.580000
      Let's see what else
   Segment 111
      0:05:41.580000 ---> 0:05:44.300000
      This one got 14,000 views
   Segment 112
      0:05:44.300000 ---> 0:05:45.660000
      19,000 views
   Segment 113
      0:05:45.660000 ---> 0:05:48.540000
      So even though it would get less views on social media
   Segment 114
      0:05:48.540000 ---> 0:05:51.260000
      You got to remember that all views are not created equal
   Segment 115
      0:05:51.260000 ---> 0:05:53.340000
      I was okay with the less amount of views
   Segment 116
      0:05:53.340000 ---> 0:05:56.220000
      Because I knew that this type of video series was going to attract
   Segment 117
      0:05:56.220000 ---> 0:05:59.820000
      Higher intent customers and it will showcase the product much more organically
   Segment 118
      0:05:59.820000 ---> 0:06:01.740000
      And being like yo this is too much to read
   Segment 119
      0:06:01.740000 ---> 0:06:03.340000
      It clearly showcases the problem
   Segment 120
      0:06:03.340000 ---> 0:06:05.420000
      Being too lazy to read an entire article
   Segment 121
      0:06:05.420000 ---> 0:06:06.380000
      And in the solution
   Segment 122
      0:06:06.380000 ---> 0:06:08.540000
      So I'm going to upload it to Nexus Research.ai
   Segment 123
      0:06:08.540000 ---> 0:06:10.460000
      Chat with it to get all the information that I want
   Segment 124
      0:06:10.460000 ---> 0:06:13.340000
      It clearly showcased the problem that this tool is facing
   Segment 125
      0:06:13.340000 ---> 0:06:15.500000
      As well as the solution that this tool provides
   Segment 126
      0:06:15.500000 ---> 0:06:17.820000
      So that was one of the two main series that I followed through
   Segment 127
      0:06:17.820000 ---> 0:06:19.100000
      It to grow my social media
   Segment 128
      0:06:19.100000 ---> 0:06:22.620000
      And this is literally all that I did to grow nexusresearch.ai
   Segment 129
      0:06:22.620000 ---> 0:06:25.980000
      So as you can see the last time that I posted on this app was almost 8 weeks ago
   Segment 130
      0:06:25.980000 ---> 0:06:29.420000
      So that's 2 months and it still regularly gets new customers
   Segment 131
      0:06:29.420000 ---> 0:06:31.340000
      And it regularly gets more payments coming in
   Segment 132
      0:06:31.340000 ---> 0:06:34.620000
      Like the MRR has been kind of stagnant at around the 400
   Segment 133
      0:06:34.620000 ---> 0:06:36.300000
      But also slowly starting to grow again
   Segment 134
      0:06:36.300000 ---> 0:06:37.580000
      So I did this across Instagram
   Segment 135
      0:06:37.580000 ---> 0:06:38.700000
      I did this across TikTok
   Segment 136
      0:06:38.700000 ---> 0:06:40.460000
      And I did this across YouTube Shorts as well
   Segment 137
      0:06:40.460000 ---> 0:06:44.700000
      That was straight up my entire growth strategy for nexusresearch.ai
   Segment 138
      0:06:44.700000 ---> 0:06:48.300000
      And the pricing for Nexus Research is just a simple subscription plan
   Segment 139
      0:06:48.300000 ---> 0:06:50.860000
      I believe I had a weekly subscription plan
   Segment 140
      0:06:50.860000 ---> 0:06:52.220000
      A monthly subscription plan
   Segment 141
      0:06:52.220000 ---> 0:06:53.660000
      And a yearly subscription plan
   Segment 142
      0:06:53.660000 ---> 0:06:56.380000
      But I will say the vast majority of my subscribers
   Segment 143
      0:06:56.380000 ---> 0:06:58.300000
      Actually used the weekly subscription plan
   Segment 144
      0:06:58.300000 ---> 0:07:01.580000
      Because most people were just using this for like one or two homework assignments in that week
   Segment 145
      0:07:01.580000 ---> 0:07:03.340000
      And they didn't have any use for it either
   Segment 146
      0:07:03.340000 ---> 0:07:05.500000
      So I loved introducing the weekly plan
   Segment 147
      0:07:05.500000 ---> 0:07:07.180000
      Yes it does introduce more churn
   Segment 148
      0:07:07.180000 ---> 0:07:09.900000
      Because it does introduce more people canceling their subscription
   Segment 149
      0:07:09.900000 ---> 0:07:11.100000
      Honestly I'm okay with that
   Segment 150
      0:07:11.100000 ---> 0:07:12.540000
      I actually think a product like this
   Segment 151
      0:07:12.540000 ---> 0:07:14.460000
      Kind of has churn built into it
   Segment 152
      0:07:14.460000 ---> 0:07:16.060000
      And I'm a personal okay with that
   Segment 153
      0:07:16.060000 ---> 0:07:17.420000
      Because this is just like a side hustle
   Segment 154
      0:07:17.420000 ---> 0:07:19.260000
      So I'm not trying to maximize the number
   Segment 155
      0:07:19.260000 ---> 0:07:21.260000
      Maximize the profit, maximize the revenue
   Segment 156
      0:07:21.260000 ---> 0:07:23.420000
      It's okay for people to churn and I've accepted that
   Segment 157
      0:07:23.420000 ---> 0:07:27.660000
      And I really do recommend people check out weekly plans in your products a lot more
   Segment 158
      0:07:27.660000 ---> 0:07:29.820000
      It's not going to work for every single product out there
   Segment 159
      0:07:29.820000 ---> 0:07:32.700000
      But I do think it's something that people do not think about as much
   Segment 160
      0:07:32.700000 ---> 0:07:34.300000
      From just the monthly
   Segment 161
      0:07:34.300000 ---> 0:07:36.940000
      And it is starting to gain a little bit more popularity
   Segment 162
      0:07:36.940000 ---> 0:07:39.020000
      Outside of just doing the monthly in the yearly
   Segment 163
      0:07:39.020000 ---> 0:07:40.780000
      So consider putting a weekly subscription
   Segment 164
      0:07:40.780000 ---> 0:07:42.460000
      Because it definitely increased conversions
   Segment 165
      0:07:42.460000 ---> 0:07:44.780000
      And it definitely increased my app's revenue for sure
   Segment 166
      0:07:44.780000 ---> 0:07:47.260000
      So then if we want to go over to the analytics page right here
   Segment 167
      0:07:47.260000 ---> 0:07:50.140000
      Which I am using post-hog to do all of my analytics
   Segment 168
      0:07:50.140000 ---> 0:07:51.420000
      Tracking for my application
   Segment 169
      0:07:51.420000 ---> 0:07:53.100000
      You can see that it's still pre-active
   Segment 170
      0:07:53.100000 ---> 0:07:57.100000
      Like every single day we get like 20, 30 messages or so being sent
   Segment 171
      0:07:57.100000 ---> 0:08:01.420000
      And then we can see the weekly active users just staying around the 600 to the 500 mark
   Segment 172
      0:08:01.420000 ---> 0:08:03.020000
      And then when we look at the retention chart
   Segment 173
      0:08:03.020000 ---> 0:08:06.060000
      You can clearly see that there's a pretty big drop-off
   Segment 174
      0:08:06.060000 ---> 0:08:08.060000
      After the week one to the week two mark
   Segment 175
      0:08:08.060000 ---> 0:08:10.860000
      So once again, this is another data point that I use to
   Segment 176
      0:08:10.860000 ---> 0:08:12.860000
      Introduce the weekly plan because it shows like
   Segment 177
      0:08:12.860000 ---> 0:08:15.900000
      Okay, most people are treating this as a weekly product
   Segment 178
      0:08:15.900000 ---> 0:08:19.340000
      Because most people are not making it past week one, week two, week three
   Segment 179
      0:08:19.340000 ---> 0:08:22.300000
      Like there's a huge drop-off from week zero to week one
   Segment 180
      0:08:22.300000 ---> 0:08:25.260000
      And then an even bigger drop-off from week one to week two
   Segment 181
      0:08:25.260000 ---> 0:08:27.020000
      People are treating this like a weekly product
   Segment 182
      0:08:27.020000 ---> 0:08:28.620000
      So let's make a weekly product
   Segment 183
      0:08:28.620000 ---> 0:08:31.020000
      Maybe more people will end up converting and purchasing the product
   Segment 184
      0:08:31.020000 ---> 0:08:32.460000
      And lo and behold, they did
   Segment 185
      0:08:32.460000 ---> 0:08:34.700000
      And that is a great example of tracking everything
   Segment 186
      0:08:34.700000 ---> 0:08:38.620000
      Analyzing your metrics to make informed decisions about your product
   Segment 187
      0:08:38.620000 ---> 0:08:41.580000
      Now we've talked about how Nexus makes around 450 bucks a month
   Segment 188
      0:08:41.580000 ---> 0:08:45.020000
      A revenue, but how much cost am I actually having to incur as well?
   Segment 189
      0:08:45.020000 ---> 0:08:47.740000
      For Nexus, there are three major costs associated with it
   Segment 190
      0:08:47.740000 ---> 0:08:51.660000
      Number one is OpenAI, which is the AI that we use to power Nexus
   Segment 191
      0:08:51.660000 ---> 0:08:55.580000
      Number two is Pinecone, which is the vector database that we use to power Nexus
   Segment 192
      0:08:55.580000 ---> 0:08:58.620000
      And then number three is Vercel, which is our hosting platform
   Segment 193
      0:08:58.620000 ---> 0:09:02.060000
      So for OpenAI, our last month's bill was nine bucks
   Segment 194
      0:09:02.060000 ---> 0:09:03.340000
      Really, really cheap
   Segment 195
      0:09:03.340000 ---> 0:09:06.540000
      And then for Pinecone, our bill was actually free
   Segment 196
      0:09:06.540000 ---> 0:09:08.620000
      Because I applied for some startup credits
   Segment 197
      0:09:08.620000 ---> 0:09:11.740000
      And I am still just chipping away at the startup credits right here
   Segment 198
      0:09:11.740000 ---> 0:09:15.340000
      But I think I did some really rough back-of-the-napkin calculations
   Segment 199
      0:09:15.340000 ---> 0:09:19.260000
      As to how much Pinecone would cost us if we didn't have the startup credits
   Segment 200
      0:09:19.260000 ---> 0:09:22.780000
      And I think it costs maybe like five, ten bucks a month
   Segment 201
      0:09:22.780000 ---> 0:09:24.220000
      So still really cheap
   Segment 202
      0:09:24.220000 ---> 0:09:27.420000
      And then for Vercel hosting, I just paid 20 bucks a month for a pro plan
   Segment 203
      0:09:27.420000 ---> 0:09:30.700000
      To host everything within this organization of YATB
   Segment 204
      0:09:30.700000 ---> 0:09:34.300000
      So for that 20 bucks a month for the entire organization of YATB
   Segment 205
      0:09:34.300000 ---> 0:09:36.780000
      I'm actually paying 20 bucks a month to host multiple apps
   Segment 206
      0:09:36.780000 ---> 0:09:40.860000
      So not only Nexus, but also the second product that I'm going to be talking about later in this video
   Segment 207
      0:09:40.860000 ---> 0:09:42.140000
      A perfect interview to AI
   Segment 208
      0:09:42.140000 ---> 0:09:46.300000
      And last but not least, we are using planet scale as our SQL provider in the back end
   Segment 209
      0:09:46.300000 ---> 0:09:48.940000
      And unfortunately, planet scale got rid of their free plan
   Segment 210
      0:09:48.940000 ---> 0:09:51.900000
      And now we have to pay 40 bucks a month to use their database
   Segment 211
      0:09:51.900000 ---> 0:09:54.700000
      Kind of expensive, at least for what we need it for right now
   Segment 212
      0:09:54.700000 ---> 0:09:57.340000
      But the entire app is already built on planet scale
   Segment 213
      0:09:57.340000 ---> 0:09:59.260000
      And we just don't want to move away from it
   Segment 214
      0:09:59.260000 ---> 0:10:03.900000
      So that brings our total cost to roughly like 80 bucks a month or so
   Segment 215
      0:10:03.900000 ---> 0:10:07.100000
      For Nexus Research.ai off of $450 a revenue
   Segment 216
      0:10:07.100000 ---> 0:10:08.860000
      Still a pretty healthy profit margins
   Segment 217
      0:10:08.860000 ---> 0:10:11.580000
      So that is a quick overview of Nexus Research.ai
   Segment 218
      0:10:11.580000 ---> 0:10:15.580000
      What the product is, my revenue as well as my growth strategy with social media
   Segment 219
      0:10:15.580000 ---> 0:10:19.020000
      So the second app that I also have, the generating around 500 bucks a month
   Segment 220
      0:10:19.020000 ---> 0:10:21.180000
      Is this app called perfectinterview.ai
   Segment 221
      0:10:21.180000 ---> 0:10:23.820000
      It is an AI powered mock interviewing tool
   Segment 222
      0:10:23.820000 ---> 0:10:27.180000
      And the way that it works is we generate unlimited practice interview questions
   Segment 223
      0:10:27.180000 ---> 0:10:28.300000
      With the help of AI
   Segment 224
      0:10:28.300000 ---> 0:10:31.420000
      So as you can see, the way that it works is somebody uploads a job description
   Segment 225
      0:10:31.420000 ---> 0:10:35.100000
      And then from that job description it generates an unlimited number of practice questions
   Segment 226
      0:10:35.100000 ---> 0:10:37.580000
      So then within those practice questions, you can then answer them
   Segment 227
      0:10:37.580000 ---> 0:10:39.820000
      Get AI to help generate and answer for you
   Segment 228
      0:10:39.820000 ---> 0:10:42.940000
      Or rewrite your answer to make it sound smarter, make it sound more concise
   Segment 229
      0:10:42.940000 ---> 0:10:45.580000
      And you can also upload your resume, your cover letter
   Segment 230
      0:10:45.580000 ---> 0:10:48.860000
      Such that whenever we generate these interview questions and help generate answers
   Segment 231
      0:10:48.860000 ---> 0:10:52.380000
      To these interview questions, it's all based off of your previous work experience
   Segment 232
      0:10:52.380000 ---> 0:10:54.380000
      So that is the overall product
   Segment 233
      0:10:54.380000 ---> 0:10:58.620000
      And once again, the tech stack is not any different from the nexus research.ai app
   Segment 234
      0:10:58.620000 ---> 0:11:02.540000
      Or the video that I had previously where I talked about my go to tech stack
   Segment 235
      0:11:02.540000 ---> 0:11:03.900000
      Everything is done on next.js
   Segment 236
      0:11:03.900000 ---> 0:11:06.700000
      Although this landing page is built on framer.com
   Segment 237
      0:11:06.700000 ---> 0:11:08.460000
      So the landing page is hosted on framer
   Segment 238
      0:11:08.460000 ---> 0:11:11.980000
      But the actual app itself is hosted on Vercelle with next.js
   Segment 239
      0:11:11.980000 ---> 0:11:15.740000
      And once again, databases plan a scale authentication provider is clerk
   Segment 240
      0:11:15.740000 ---> 0:11:18.140000
      You already know the whole gist, make sure to watch that video
   Segment 241
      0:11:18.140000 ---> 0:11:20.380000
      Where I explain my tech stack for more details
   Segment 242
      0:11:20.380000 ---> 0:11:22.780000
      So now let's go over to some of the revenue numbers
   Segment 243
      0:11:22.780000 ---> 0:11:24.620000
      So perfect interview is a different product
   Segment 244
      0:11:24.620000 ---> 0:11:27.660000
      Because unlike nexus research, which was a subscription base
   Segment 245
      0:11:27.660000 ---> 0:11:30.060000
      This is largely one time purchase base
   Segment 246
      0:11:30.060000 ---> 0:11:33.420000
      We actually AAB tested it and we found that our conversion rate
   Segment 247
      0:11:33.420000 ---> 0:11:37.740000
      When we were offering a subscription plan was roughly 0.6 or 0.7
   Segment 248
      0:11:37.740000 ---> 0:11:41.820000
      But then when we test compared to the people that had one time purchase as an option
   Segment 249
      0:11:41.820000 ---> 0:11:43.900000
      For the same exact price, let me say
   Segment 250
      0:11:43.900000 ---> 0:11:47.900000
      Well, the conversion rate for the one time purchase was roughly 1.3, 1.5
   Segment 251
      0:11:48.460000 ---> 0:11:49.980000
      It was straight up so much higher
   Segment 252
      0:11:49.980000 ---> 0:11:53.900000
      So that was a good signal for us to be like, all right, one time purchases is the move
   Segment 253
      0:11:53.900000 ---> 0:11:55.900000
      And I talked about this in some previous videos too
   Segment 254
      0:11:55.900000 ---> 0:11:59.020000
      But I really do think a lot of SaaS companies and SaaS products
   Segment 255
      0:11:59.580000 ---> 0:12:02.140000
      Should consider one time purchases a lot more
   Segment 256
      0:12:02.140000 ---> 0:12:05.660000
      And the way that this app perfect interview does one time purchases
   Segment 257
      0:12:05.660000 ---> 0:12:09.180000
      Is the fact that each job description that you upload
   Segment 258
      0:12:09.180000 ---> 0:12:10.860000
      Like the job, the company description
   Segment 259
      0:12:10.860000 ---> 0:12:12.780000
      And we generate all those interview questions for you
   Segment 260
      0:12:12.780000 ---> 0:12:14.460000
      That is one purchase of right now
   Segment 261
      0:12:14.460000 ---> 0:12:16.300000
      I think it's $20 or $15
   Segment 262
      0:12:16.300000 ---> 0:12:17.580000
      I don't know what the current price is
   Segment 263
      0:12:17.580000 ---> 0:12:18.860000
      It's been a while since I touched it
   Segment 264
      0:12:18.860000 ---> 0:12:20.700000
      But that was a good way to box it in saying
   Segment 265
      0:12:20.700000 ---> 0:12:22.620000
      Hey, you pay us $15, $20
   Segment 266
      0:12:22.620000 ---> 0:12:26.620000
      You get to upload one custom job description and interview prep with it forever for life
   Segment 267
      0:12:26.620000 ---> 0:12:28.380000
      And then a lot of people have left comments saying like
   Segment 268
      0:12:28.380000 ---> 0:12:32.140000
      Oh, but are you worried that providing lifetime access to a certain part of your product
   Segment 269
      0:12:32.140000 ---> 0:12:33.180000
      Is going to increase cost?
   Segment 270
      0:12:33.180000 ---> 0:12:33.900000
      Because yes, you're right
   Segment 271
      0:12:33.900000 ---> 0:12:37.980000
      People can still incur like open API costs by generating answers with AI
   Segment 272
      0:12:37.980000 ---> 0:12:39.660000
      Or rewriting their answer with AI
   Segment 273
      0:12:39.660000 ---> 0:12:40.140000
      That's true
   Segment 274
      0:12:40.140000 ---> 0:12:44.620000
      But as of right now our retention and the usage of the product is pretty low as well
   Segment 275
      0:12:44.620000 ---> 0:12:47.180000
      So we're pretty confident that that is not going to be an issue
   Segment 276
      0:12:47.180000 ---> 0:12:49.660000
      Because most people for perfect interviews use case at least
   Segment 277
      0:12:49.660000 ---> 0:12:52.140000
      Use the product for one job interview that they have
   Segment 278
      0:12:52.140000 ---> 0:12:53.820000
      And the minute that they have that job interview
   Segment 279
      0:12:53.820000 ---> 0:12:55.340000
      They're done, they never use it again
   Segment 280
      0:12:55.340000 ---> 0:12:57.340000
      So obviously every single product is different
   Segment 281
      0:12:57.340000 ---> 0:12:59.900000
      Not every product fits with a one time purchase plan
   Segment 282
      0:12:59.900000 ---> 0:13:03.260000
      But I do think a lot more products fit with a one time purchase plan
   Segment 283
      0:13:03.260000 ---> 0:13:04.700000
      Than people give credit for it
   Segment 284
      0:13:04.700000 ---> 0:13:06.940000
      So I really recommend if you want to increase conversions
   Segment 285
      0:13:06.940000 ---> 0:13:08.140000
      Try out the one time purchase
   Segment 286
      0:13:08.140000 ---> 0:13:09.420000
      I think it works really great
   Segment 287
      0:13:09.420000 ---> 0:13:11.580000
      And I personally with perfect interview right here
   Segment 288
      0:13:11.580000 ---> 0:13:13.900000
      Thought double the conversion rate compared to subscription
   Segment 289
      0:13:13.980000 ---> 0:13:15.980000
      So as you can see for the revenue right here
   Segment 290
      0:13:15.980000 ---> 0:13:18.220000
      And then if we look at this year's current revenue
   Segment 291
      0:13:18.220000 ---> 0:13:22.700000
      You can see that we have done roughly two thousand dollars of gross volume
   Segment 292
      0:13:22.700000 ---> 0:13:24.940000
      And net volume from sales is fifteen hundred dollars
   Segment 293
      0:13:24.940000 ---> 0:13:27.180000
      So that's with all the fees taken out and everything
   Segment 294
      0:13:27.180000 ---> 0:13:29.820000
      And once again the way that I ended up growing perfect interview
   Segment 295
      0:13:29.820000 ---> 0:13:31.420000
      Was all through social media
   Segment 296
      0:13:31.420000 ---> 0:13:33.660000
      But this time I actually have a co-founder
   Segment 297
      0:13:33.660000 ---> 0:13:35.980000
      Who does all the social media marketing for me
   Segment 298
      0:13:35.980000 ---> 0:13:37.740000
      And I actually don't have to post all of those videos
   Segment 299
      0:13:37.740000 ---> 0:13:40.220000
      So let's go over to check out the app right here
   Segment 300
      0:13:40.220000 ---> 0:13:41.500000
      So this is the Instagram page
   Segment 301
      0:13:41.500000 ---> 0:13:43.660000
      And we also have a TikTok page, a YouTube page
   Segment 302
      0:13:43.660000 ---> 0:13:45.900000
      That's posting the same exact format
   Segment 303
      0:13:45.900000 ---> 0:13:46.540000
      Nothing different
   Segment 304
      0:13:46.540000 ---> 0:13:49.260000
      Now I will say with this account a perfect interview.ai
   Segment 305
      0:13:49.260000 ---> 0:13:50.540000
      We definitely had an advantage
   Segment 306
      0:13:50.540000 ---> 0:13:53.020000
      Because my co-founder, Meng Meng Duck on social media
   Segment 307
      0:13:53.020000 ---> 0:13:55.900000
      He posted these collaboration posts on Instagram
   Segment 308
      0:13:55.900000 ---> 0:13:58.620000
      Essentially he posts a valuable video on his main account
   Segment 309
      0:13:58.620000 ---> 0:13:59.420000
      Which is pretty big
   Segment 310
      0:13:59.420000 ---> 0:14:02.540000
      And he collaboration posts it with a perfect interview account
   Segment 311
      0:14:02.540000 ---> 0:14:04.940000
      So that we get a lot more eyeballs on the perfect interview account
   Segment 312
      0:14:04.940000 ---> 0:14:06.860000
      And this one is a great example of that
   Segment 313
      0:14:06.860000 ---> 0:14:08.620000
      You can see that he did a collaboration post
   Segment 314
      0:14:08.620000 ---> 0:14:10.140000
      Between perfect interview.ai
   Segment 315
      0:14:10.300000 ---> 0:14:11.980000
      And Meng Meng Duck for this video
   Segment 316
      0:14:11.980000 ---> 0:14:15.740000
      And we got a lot of eyeballs onto the perfect interview.ai account because of that
   Segment 317
      0:14:15.740000 ---> 0:14:17.500000
      But we can't do that for every single post
   Segment 318
      0:14:17.500000 ---> 0:14:19.340000
      And we post a lot of original content
   Segment 319
      0:14:19.340000 ---> 0:14:20.780000
      Strictly for perfect interview
   Segment 320
      0:14:20.780000 ---> 0:14:22.140000
      And there's a mix of content that we've done
   Segment 321
      0:14:22.140000 ---> 0:14:25.980000
      We still haven't quite honed in on the strategy of what content does well
   Segment 322
      0:14:25.980000 ---> 0:14:27.980000
      But we did this one street interview series
   Segment 323
      0:14:27.980000 ---> 0:14:30.860000
      Where we were trying to guess people's jobs in New York City
   Segment 324
      0:14:30.860000 ---> 0:14:33.020000
      Because it's kind of job related and perfect interview
   Segment 325
      0:14:33.020000 ---> 0:14:34.620000
      It's definitely a job related tool
   Segment 326
      0:14:34.620000 ---> 0:14:36.460000
      Co-founder actually has this series
   Segment 327
      0:14:36.460000 ---> 0:14:38.300000
      Where he just does this silly face
   Segment 328
      0:14:38.300000 ---> 0:14:39.820000
      Of looking super surprised
   Segment 329
      0:14:39.820000 ---> 0:14:41.100000
      And then in this type of video
   Segment 330
      0:14:41.100000 ---> 0:14:43.420000
      He then highlights the product, films the product
   Segment 331
      0:14:43.420000 ---> 0:14:45.820000
      And shows off the various features of the product as well
   Segment 332
      0:14:45.820000 ---> 0:14:46.780000
      So we'll watch this
   Segment 333
      0:14:46.780000 ---> 0:14:47.580000
      You can see right here
   Segment 334
      0:14:47.580000 ---> 0:14:49.740000
      Now we're transitioning to showing the job
   Segment 335
      0:14:49.740000 ---> 0:14:52.140000
      Showing the app how it works and all of that
   Segment 336
      0:14:52.140000 ---> 0:14:54.140000
      And somehow this video type
   Segment 337
      0:14:54.140000 ---> 0:14:56.220000
      Goes pretty viral time and time again
   Segment 338
      0:14:56.220000 ---> 0:14:58.140000
      Every time that he does it as you can see
   Segment 339
      0:14:58.140000 ---> 0:15:00.460000
      This video got 15,000 views
   Segment 340
      0:15:00.460000 ---> 0:15:02.620000
      But then another video of a similar format
   Segment 341
      0:15:02.620000 ---> 0:15:03.180000
      Let's see
   Segment 342
      0:15:03.180000 ---> 0:15:04.780000
      It's gotten like 10,000 views
   Segment 343
      0:15:04.780000 ---> 0:15:05.900000
      13,000 views
   Segment 344
      0:15:05.900000 ---> 0:15:07.500000
      123,000 views
   Segment 345
      0:15:07.500000 ---> 0:15:09.180000
      So he found this format that works
   Segment 346
      0:15:09.180000 ---> 0:15:11.500000
      Of showcasing the product and its various features
   Segment 347
      0:15:11.500000 ---> 0:15:13.820000
      And that was literally our entire growth strategy
   Segment 348
      0:15:13.820000 ---> 0:15:15.260000
      It's just pure social media
   Segment 349
      0:15:15.260000 ---> 0:15:16.700000
      And it makes 500 bucks a month
   Segment 350
      0:15:16.700000 ---> 0:15:18.780000
      Now do we think that it could be bigger
   Segment 351
      0:15:18.780000 ---> 0:15:20.540000
      If we did other marketing strategies?
   Segment 352
      0:15:20.540000 ---> 0:15:20.860000
      Yes
   Segment 353
      0:15:20.860000 ---> 0:15:23.340000
      We are exploring some other marketing strategies as well
   Segment 354
      0:15:23.340000 ---> 0:15:24.700000
      To try to get more impressions
   Segment 355
      0:15:24.700000 ---> 0:15:26.380000
      And more people to know about the product
   Segment 356
      0:15:26.380000 ---> 0:15:28.380000
      But we haven't had any success with them quite yet
   Segment 357
      0:15:28.380000 ---> 0:15:29.500000
      We're still a little early
   Segment 358
      0:15:29.500000 ---> 0:15:30.620000
      And we can confidently say
   Segment 359
      0:15:30.620000 ---> 0:15:32.300000
      The only real marketing that we have done
   Segment 360
      0:15:32.300000 ---> 0:15:33.020000
      Is social media
   Segment 361
      0:15:33.020000 ---> 0:15:35.500000
      And that is where 100% of our revenue has come from
   Segment 362
      0:15:35.500000 ---> 0:15:37.100000
      And then if we go over to our analytics
   Segment 363
      0:15:37.100000 ---> 0:15:39.020000
      And we go over to our retention graph
   Segment 364
      0:15:39.020000 ---> 0:15:41.180000
      Once again, kind of similarly to Nexus Research
   Segment 365
      0:15:41.180000 ---> 0:15:42.460000
      You can clearly see that
   Segment 366
      0:15:42.460000 ---> 0:15:44.220000
      This is not a tool that people will use
   Segment 367
      0:15:44.220000 ---> 0:15:46.380000
      For significant portions of their life
   Segment 368
      0:15:46.380000 ---> 0:15:47.660000
      For weeks and months on time
   Segment 369
      0:15:47.660000 ---> 0:15:48.860000
      You can see that the drop off
   Segment 370
      0:15:48.860000 ---> 0:15:50.620000
      The retention drop off is really big
   Segment 371
      0:15:50.620000 ---> 0:15:52.460000
      After week one, after week two
   Segment 372
      0:15:52.460000 ---> 0:15:54.220000
      Once again indicating that this is better off
   Segment 373
      0:15:54.220000 ---> 0:15:55.340000
      It's like a weekly product
   Segment 374
      0:15:55.340000 ---> 0:15:57.420000
      Or just a one time purchase based product
   Segment 375
      0:15:57.420000 ---> 0:15:59.260000
      And that was another data point that we used
   Segment 376
      0:15:59.260000 ---> 0:16:01.180000
      To transition to just treating this product
   Segment 377
      0:16:01.180000 ---> 0:16:02.220000
      Not as a subscription
   Segment 378
      0:16:02.220000 ---> 0:16:04.540000
      And instead offering it as a one time purchase
   Segment 379
      0:16:04.540000 ---> 0:16:06.540000
      And once again, because we used our analytics
   Segment 380
      0:16:06.540000 ---> 0:16:08.220000
      Because we used the data that we have
   Segment 381
      0:16:08.220000 ---> 0:16:11.100000
      To make that decision of turning it into a one time product
   Segment 382
      0:16:11.100000 ---> 0:16:12.780000
      We were able to increase our conversion rate
   Segment 383
      0:16:12.780000 ---> 0:16:13.660000
      Increase our revenue
   Segment 384
      0:16:13.660000 ---> 0:16:14.620000
      And it's been pretty good so far
   Segment 385
      0:16:14.620000 ---> 0:16:15.580000
      So for a perfect interview
   Segment 386
      0:16:15.580000 ---> 0:16:18.540000
      We've talked about how it makes roughly 500 bucks a month of revenue
   Segment 387
      0:16:18.540000 ---> 0:16:20.700000
      But what are the costs associated with it as well?
   Segment 388
      0:16:20.700000 ---> 0:16:21.660000
      And for a perfect interview
   Segment 389
      0:16:21.660000 ---> 0:16:24.780000
      There are three main costs that we incur
   Segment 390
      0:16:24.780000 ---> 0:16:27.100000
      Number one is OpenAI, our AI provider
   Segment 391
      0:16:27.100000 ---> 0:16:28.540000
      Number two is PlanetScale
   Segment 392
      0:16:28.540000 ---> 0:16:30.140000
      Which is our database provider
   Segment 393
      0:16:30.140000 ---> 0:16:31.340000
      And number three is Hosting
   Segment 394
      0:16:31.340000 ---> 0:16:32.460000
      Which is on on Vercel
   Segment 395
      0:16:32.460000 ---> 0:16:33.580000
      So for OpenAI
   Segment 396
      0:16:33.580000 ---> 0:16:35.820000
      As you can see, last month is actually pretty expensive
   Segment 397
      0:16:35.820000 ---> 0:16:37.420000
      It was like $137
   Segment 398
      0:16:37.420000 ---> 0:16:39.980000
      But that's because we played around with GPT-4
   Segment 399
      0:16:39.980000 ---> 0:16:41.180000
      Which is really expensive
   Segment 400
      0:16:41.180000 ---> 0:16:43.500000
      We also had some really inefficient ways
   Segment 401
      0:16:43.500000 ---> 0:16:46.140000
      Of overusing AI when we didn't need to
   Segment 402
      0:16:46.140000 ---> 0:16:47.340000
      So for the month of April
   Segment 403
      0:16:47.340000 ---> 0:16:49.820000
      It was pretty high at $137 a month
   Segment 404
      0:16:49.820000 ---> 0:16:50.940000
      But then for the month of May
   Segment 405
      0:16:50.940000 ---> 0:16:54.060000
      I think this has a lot more cost optimizations that we worked on
   Segment 406
      0:16:54.060000 ---> 0:16:55.580000
      So let's just assume
   Segment 407
      0:16:55.580000 ---> 0:16:57.260000
      Let's say I'm filming this on the 9th
   Segment 408
      0:16:57.260000 ---> 0:16:59.180000
      So 571 divided by 9
   Segment 409
      0:16:59.660000 ---> 0:17:03.740000
      And then we're gonna multiply that entire thing by 30
   Segment 410
      0:17:03.740000 ---> 0:17:05.260000
      So really, for this month
   Segment 411
      0:17:05.260000 ---> 0:17:08.140000
      I think we're gonna be looking at a $20 bill from OpenAI
   Segment 412
      0:17:08.140000 ---> 0:17:10.860000
      Which is substantially cheaper than $137
   Segment 413
      0:17:10.860000 ---> 0:17:14.380000
      Which was the previous month when we were just spending unnecessary amounts on AI
   Segment 414
      0:17:14.380000 ---> 0:17:17.180000
      We've trimmed it down, got a lot of cost saving improvements
   Segment 415
      0:17:17.180000 ---> 0:17:19.260000
      So we should be seeing roughly a $20 bill
   Segment 416
      0:17:19.260000 ---> 0:17:21.180000
      Hopefully for perfect interview.ai
   Segment 417
      0:17:21.180000 ---> 0:17:23.420000
      And for the database, we are using PlanetScale
   Segment 418
      0:17:23.420000 ---> 0:17:25.260000
      And that costs us $40 a month
   Segment 419
      0:17:25.260000 ---> 0:17:27.580000
      I was using PlanetScale when they were on their free plan
   Segment 420
      0:17:27.580000 ---> 0:17:29.820000
      But they unfortunately got rid of that recently
   Segment 421
      0:17:29.820000 ---> 0:17:31.900000
      And now we're paying $40 a month for that
   Segment 422
      0:17:31.900000 ---> 0:17:34.060000
      So that brings a total to around $60
   Segment 423
      0:17:34.060000 ---> 0:17:36.220000
      And similarly to nexusresearch.ai
   Segment 424
      0:17:36.220000 ---> 0:17:37.660000
      I am hosting this on Vercel
   Segment 425
      0:17:37.660000 ---> 0:17:39.580000
      Which I am paying $20 a month for
   Segment 426
      0:17:39.580000 ---> 0:17:41.580000
      But that same $20 a month covers
   Segment 427
      0:17:41.580000 ---> 0:17:45.500000
      Hosting for both Nexus Research as well as PerfectInterview.ai
   Segment 428
      0:17:45.500000 ---> 0:17:49.020000
      So the total cost comes out to roughly $60 to $70 a month
   Segment 429
      0:17:49.020000 ---> 0:17:51.580000
      So our total profit from $500 of revenue
   Segment 430
      0:17:51.580000 ---> 0:17:54.540000
      Is around $400 to $430 of profit
   Segment 431
      0:17:54.540000 ---> 0:17:57.900000
      So that's an overview of the products that we built on the growth strategies that we used
   Segment 432
      0:17:57.900000 ---> 0:18:00.460000
      And now in terms of the future state of the product
   Segment 433
      0:18:00.540000 ---> 0:18:02.780000
      For both of these products, I am actually thinking of
   Segment 434
      0:18:02.780000 ---> 0:18:04.780000
      Kind of just letting them coast on the side
   Segment 435
      0:18:04.780000 ---> 0:18:07.660000
      And I'm not really actively planning to work on them too much more
   Segment 436
      0:18:07.660000 ---> 0:18:09.900000
      For Nexus Research as well, the reason is because
   Segment 437
      0:18:09.900000 ---> 0:18:13.420000
      I think it's a super crowded space with a lot of other really big competitors
   Segment 438
      0:18:13.420000 ---> 0:18:15.420000
      The big reason that I'm not really planning to work on
   Segment 439
      0:18:15.420000 ---> 0:18:16.940000
      Either of these two products much more
   Segment 440
      0:18:16.940000 ---> 0:18:19.660000
      Is the fact that I'm actually working on a third product idea
   Segment 441
      0:18:19.660000 ---> 0:18:21.740000
      That I think can make a lot more money
   Segment 442
      0:18:21.740000 ---> 0:18:23.100000
      The opportunity is a lot bigger
   Segment 443
      0:18:23.100000 ---> 0:18:24.380000
      It's a higher value product
   Segment 444
      0:18:24.380000 ---> 0:18:27.580000
      Which is my biggest gripe with Nexus and PerfectInterview
   Segment 445
      0:18:27.580000 ---> 0:18:31.100000
      I really disliked how the price of the goods sold was super cheap
   Segment 446
      0:18:31.100000 ---> 0:18:33.740000
      It was like a $20 purchase, $30 purchase
   Segment 447
      0:18:33.740000 ---> 0:18:37.500000
      And it's really hard to make a substantial amount of money with a super cheap product like that
   Segment 448
      0:18:37.500000 ---> 0:18:40.140000
      You need a lot of volume and I think that's got pretty hard
   Segment 449
      0:18:40.140000 ---> 0:18:43.020000
      And at the same time, and because these are more of B2C products
   Segment 450
      0:18:43.020000 ---> 0:18:44.700000
      Rather than a B2B product
   Segment 451
      0:18:44.700000 ---> 0:18:47.740000
      It would be pretty hard to increase the price really substantially
   Segment 452
      0:18:47.740000 ---> 0:18:50.300000
      Without getting some type of backlash from our existing customers
   Segment 453
      0:18:50.300000 ---> 0:18:53.340000
      So for that reason, neither of my co-founders or either of the two apps
   Segment 454
      0:18:53.340000 ---> 0:18:55.100000
      Really want to continue building it out
   Segment 455
      0:18:55.100000 ---> 0:18:56.860000
      And we're okay just letting it coast
   Segment 456
      0:18:56.860000 ---> 0:19:00.860000
      Making some really passive income like 500 bucks a month on the side
   Segment 457
      0:19:00.860000 ---> 0:19:02.380000
      And we're okay with leaving it at that
   Segment 458
      0:19:02.380000 ---> 0:19:03.900000
      And with PerfectInterview.ai
   Segment 459
      0:19:03.900000 ---> 0:19:06.380000
      We know what it would take for us to 10X their revenue
   Segment 460
      0:19:06.380000 ---> 0:19:10.300000
      To become like a $5,000, $10,000 monthly revenue product
   Segment 461
      0:19:10.300000 ---> 0:19:13.500000
      But to do that, we would need to shift our social media marketing
   Segment 462
      0:19:13.500000 ---> 0:19:16.140000
      To be very much so like career advice driven
   Segment 463
      0:19:16.140000 ---> 0:19:17.820000
      Where we want to be a career influencer
   Segment 464
      0:19:17.820000 ---> 0:19:19.820000
      Provide job to crudy tips
   Segment 465
      0:19:19.820000 ---> 0:19:22.300000
      But at the end of the day, my co-founder Andrew and I
   Segment 466
      0:19:22.300000 ---> 0:19:24.140000
      Who is making me duck on social media
   Segment 467
      0:19:24.140000 ---> 0:19:26.860000
      We don't feel like we are the right founders to do that
   Segment 468
      0:19:26.860000 ---> 0:19:29.740000
      Neither of us are super gung-ho about making that type of content
   Segment 469
      0:19:29.740000 ---> 0:19:31.740000
      We don't wake up and get super excited
   Segment 470
      0:19:31.740000 ---> 0:19:34.380000
      With the idea of helping other people land their jobs
   Segment 471
      0:19:34.380000 ---> 0:19:38.060000
      Don't get me wrong, other people definitely are that excited and get excited in that space
   Segment 472
      0:19:38.060000 ---> 0:19:39.420000
      But that's just not us
   Segment 473
      0:19:39.420000 ---> 0:19:42.860000
      And then on top of that, we actually found another idea that we're very interested
   Segment 474
      0:19:42.860000 ---> 0:19:45.900000
      On working on that we think is much more up our alley
   Segment 475
      0:19:45.900000 ---> 0:19:49.260000
      Where we have a lot better creator product fit
   Segment 476
      0:19:49.260000 ---> 0:19:50.620000
      Founder product fit
   Segment 477
      0:19:50.620000 ---> 0:19:53.340000
      And top where we can be where we're much more excited to build
   Segment 478
      0:19:53.340000 ---> 0:19:55.020000
      Talk market the product
   Segment 479
      0:19:55.020000 ---> 0:19:58.460000
      So that's why we're going to be shifting all of our focus into this third product
   Segment 480
      0:19:58.460000 ---> 0:20:02.300000
      And once again, letting perfect interview.ai and letting nexusresearch.ai
   Segment 481
      0:20:02.300000 ---> 0:20:06.060000
      Kind of just coast off into the sunset and make some small amount of cash
   Segment 482
      0:20:06.060000 ---> 0:20:07.020000
      Every single month
   Segment 483
      0:20:07.020000 ---> 0:20:11.580000
      That's an overview of the two stats products that I built that make $500 a month of recurring revenue
   Segment 484
      0:20:11.580000 ---> 0:20:13.020000
      So let me know in the comments down below
   Segment 485
      0:20:13.020000 ---> 0:20:15.420000
      If you have any other questions that I can help answer
   Segment 486
      0:20:15.420000 ---> 0:20:19.500000
      If there's any part of the product that you are curious about that I didn't go over in this video
   Segment 487
      0:20:19.500000 ---> 0:20:21.260000
      Let me know how I can help but other than that
   Segment 488
      0:20:21.260000 ---> 0:20:23.660000
      Thanks so much for watching the video and I'll see you in the next one
