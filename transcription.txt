   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:10
      In this video, we are going to look at Sophanesba Anguassola's portrait of the artists, sisters, and brother.
   Segment 2
      0:00:10 ---> 0:00:16.500000
      Sophanesba Anguassola was an artist whose body of work spanned several-style periods,
   Segment 3
      0:00:16.500000 ---> 0:00:22.500000
      but the painting we're going to look at here might perhaps be best described as manorist.
   Segment 4
      0:00:22.500000 ---> 0:00:26.700000
      Not incidentally, she actually lived into her 90s,
   Segment 5
      0:00:26.700000 ---> 0:00:30
      which is a pretty remarkable lifespan for that era,
   Segment 6
      0:00:30 ---> 0:00:35.200000
      hence explaining why her work spans again these multiple-style periods.
   Segment 7
      0:00:35.200000 ---> 0:00:40.700000
      Now, I think we would be remiss to not mention up front the elephant in the room.
   Segment 8
      0:00:40.700000 ---> 0:00:46.700000
      Anguassola was a woman, which is sort of a rare sighting early on in this course.
   Segment 9
      0:00:46.700000 ---> 0:00:54.700000
      Indeed, the Renaissance era saw the slow emergence of named women artists breaking into the professional art world.
   Segment 10
      0:00:54.700000 ---> 0:01:01.700000
      However, these women were rare and severely limited by the bounds of social constraints.
   Segment 11
      0:01:01.700000 ---> 0:01:08.200000
      Until the 19th century, most professional women artists in the West were relatively privileged
   Segment 12
      0:01:08.200000 ---> 0:01:15.700000
      in terms of their socioeconomic position, and they all came from unusually supportive families.
   Segment 13
      0:01:15.700000 ---> 0:01:22.200000
      Often, their fathers were artists themselves, and were able to pass their knowledge down to their daughter
   Segment 14
      0:01:22.200000 ---> 0:01:26.200000
      without the need for a separate education or apprenticeship.
   Segment 15
      0:01:26.200000 ---> 0:01:32.200000
      For her part, Anguassola came from a noble but modestly wealthy family
   Segment 16
      0:01:32.200000 ---> 0:01:38.200000
      that was fairly progressive at the time in terms of encouraging their daughters to pursue education.
   Segment 17
      0:01:38.200000 ---> 0:01:46.200000
      Hence, Anguassola was afforded more education and freedom than the average woman of her day.
   Segment 18
      0:01:46.200000 ---> 0:01:52.200000
      Though she and some other women found a degree of success as artists and patrons,
   Segment 19
      0:01:52.200000 ---> 0:01:58.200000
      it remained institutionally and culturally difficult for them to do so.
   Segment 20
      0:01:58.200000 ---> 0:02:05.200000
      Anguassola is best known today for her charming portraits, and it's not hard to see why.
   Segment 21
      0:02:05.200000 ---> 0:02:08.200000
      I mean, look at these little individuals.
   Segment 22
      0:02:08.200000 ---> 0:02:14.200000
      Each one of these children seems to possess their own personalities and their own way about them.
   Segment 23
      0:02:14.200000 ---> 0:02:21.200000
      The eldest daughter looks as though she is trying to appear quite mature, quite grown up and mannered,
   Segment 24
      0:02:21.200000 ---> 0:02:29.200000
      while the younger two are slightly less poised, though still acting appropriately for their rank.
   Segment 25
      0:02:29.200000 ---> 0:02:36.200000
      As is the case here, many of her existing works feature her siblings, which makes sense,
   Segment 26
      0:02:36.200000 ---> 0:02:40.200000
      as these were the faces most available to her as a woman,
   Segment 27
      0:02:40.200000 ---> 0:02:45.200000
      who would have lived a more sequestered life than her male peers.
   Segment 28
      0:02:45.200000 ---> 0:02:49.200000
      The children in this work exist in an ambiguous green background,
   Segment 29
      0:02:49.200000 ---> 0:02:55.200000
      creating a striking composition that really highlights their curious countenances.
   Segment 30
      0:02:55.200000 ---> 0:03:02.200000
      Where's the early and the high renaissance heavily favored naturalistic architectural settings,
   Segment 31
      0:03:02.200000 ---> 0:03:08.200000
      manorous paintings frequently employed these nondescript surroundings.
   Segment 32
      0:03:08.200000 ---> 0:03:14.200000
      Moreover, looking at the bodies, we can see some playfulness with regard to anatomy.
   Segment 33
      0:03:14.200000 ---> 0:03:18.200000
      The shoulders slope a bit too steeply into the arms.
   Segment 34
      0:03:18.200000 ---> 0:03:28.200000
      On the one hand, this Lucy Goosey play with anatomy is exactly the kind of graceful exaggeration preferred by manorous artists.
   Segment 35
      0:03:28.200000 ---> 0:03:37.200000
      On the other hand, this approximated anatomical style may have also been particularly appealing to Anguassola,
   Segment 36
      0:03:37.200000 ---> 0:03:43.200000
      given that the study of anatomy and life drawing would have been withheld from her as a woman.
   Segment 37
      0:03:43.200000 ---> 0:03:52.200000
      You see, it was seen as inappropriate for women to be exposed to nudity, so of course that presented a challenge.
   Segment 38
      0:03:52.200000 ---> 0:03:59.200000
      Portraits as a kind of painting were becoming increasingly popular in Europe at this time.
   Segment 39
      0:03:59.200000 ---> 0:04:06.200000
      This is probably a result of the pervasiveness of humanism, which promotes an interest in the individual.
   Segment 40
      0:04:06.200000 ---> 0:04:11.200000
      Rising to a remarkably high professional level for a woman of her day,
   Segment 41
      0:04:11.200000 ---> 0:04:20.200000
      Anguassola was hired as a Spanish court artist, commissioned to paint royal portraits of Queen Elizabeth, wife of Philip II.
   Segment 42
      0:04:20.200000 ---> 0:04:24.200000
      Anguassola was an exceptional portraitist.
   Segment 43
      0:04:24.200000 ---> 0:04:32.200000
      In this portrait of Queen Elizabeth, there is a sort of fire and personality in the eyes, similar to what we see in the other portrait,
   Segment 44
      0:04:32.200000 ---> 0:04:35.200000
      that can be quite difficult to achieve.
   Segment 45
      0:04:35.200000 ---> 0:04:44.200000
      At the same time though, as a woman artist, Anguassola didn't really have much choice but to be a portraitist.
   Segment 46
      0:04:44.200000 ---> 0:04:50.200000
      Although Anguassola was one of the few women featured in Vasari's Lives of the Artists,
   Segment 47
      0:04:50.200000 ---> 0:04:59.200000
      and Michelangelo was listed among her professional admirers, large public commissions, like, for example, the Sistine Chapel ceiling,
   Segment 48
      0:04:59.200000 ---> 0:05:03.200000
      would have been all together denied her.
   Segment 49
      0:05:03.200000 ---> 0:05:12.200000
      So fast-forward some years, after the Queen Elizabeth's death, she was sent back to Italy where the king had arranged a marriage for her.
   Segment 50
      0:05:12.200000 ---> 0:05:19.200000
      Although her professional life, thereafter somewhat quieted, her reputation persisted among artists.
   Segment 51
      0:05:19.200000 ---> 0:05:29.200000
      Evident by this 1624 portrait by a young portraitist Anthony Van Dyke, who pilgrimage to meet the elderly Anguassola.
   Segment 52
      0:05:29.200000 ---> 0:05:41.200000
      In conclusion, Sophanesba Anguassola was an artist whose work spans several artistic periods, but whose most famous work might be described as manorist.
   Segment 53
      0:05:41.200000 ---> 0:05:52.200000
      Her renown largely stems from her skills as a portraitist, and indeed, her portraits seem to embody compellingly individualized personalities.
   Segment 54
      0:05:52.200000 ---> 0:06:02.200000
      On the one hand, her exaggerated manorist style and her professional emphasis on portraiture may have been in part to do with her interests,
   Segment 55
      0:06:02.200000 ---> 0:06:05.200000
      her preferences, and skill sets.
   Segment 56
      0:06:05.200000 ---> 0:06:16.200000
      However, on the other hand, her educational and professional limitations as a woman during an oppressive era likely also played a factor in these decisions.
   Segment 57
      0:06:16.200000 ---> 0:06:28.200000
      Despite the social barriers set in place for her, Anguassola achieved much professional success, and seems to have lived a long and relatively happy life.

Transcription for audio10.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:04.400000
      In this video, we're going to be discussing the art of Paula Moderson Becker,
   Segment 2
      0:00:04.400000 ---> 0:00:10
      who was a German Vorp's feed artist who was associated with the German expressionists.
   Segment 3
      0:00:10 ---> 0:00:17.200000
      I don't have a good meme for a Moderson Becker, so here I'm using a Google Doodle instead that I thought was a pretty cool one.
   Segment 4
      0:00:17.700000 ---> 0:00:22.300000
      In the years after Germany became a nation in 1871,
   Segment 5
      0:00:22.300000 ---> 0:00:25.300000
      artists were increasingly asking themselves,
   Segment 6
      0:00:25.300000 ---> 0:00:27.300000
      what is German about German art?
   Segment 7
      0:00:27.300000 ---> 0:00:30.800000
      How can I express German-ness through my art?
   Segment 8
      0:00:30.800000 ---> 0:00:39.800000
      For the most part, the governmentally and culturally approved art was quite traditional in its appearance and its subject matter.
   Segment 9
      0:00:39.800000 ---> 0:00:42.800000
      Although not directly working for the government,
   Segment 10
      0:00:42.800000 ---> 0:00:50.300000
      the artist colonies that emerged during this time in Germany also tended to be pretty pro-Germany.
   Segment 11
      0:00:50.400000 ---> 0:00:55.300000
      The early 19th century was a highly nationalist time in Germany.
   Segment 12
      0:00:55.300000 ---> 0:01:04.100000
      Nationalism is different than patriotism in that nationalism is not just about the pride one takes in one state,
   Segment 13
      0:01:04.100000 ---> 0:01:08.500000
      rather pride in a shared culture, and in extreme versions,
   Segment 14
      0:01:08.500000 ---> 0:01:13.900000
      nationalism is characterized by a feeling of superiority over other nations,
   Segment 15
      0:01:13.900000 ---> 0:01:17.900000
      leading in its extreme forms to things like fascism.
   Segment 16
      0:01:18 ---> 0:01:24.900000
      A colony called Worp's Feed was the most important artist colony in Germany of the early 20th century.
   Segment 17
      0:01:24.900000 ---> 0:01:28.900000
      It was heavily invested in a type of modernist primitivism
   Segment 18
      0:01:28.900000 ---> 0:01:35.400000
      that was rooted in a cult of the German folk, a celebration of Germanic rural people.
   Segment 19
      0:01:35.400000 ---> 0:01:41.400000
      Although some modern artists were interested in making commentary about the conditions of modernity
   Segment 20
      0:01:41.400000 ---> 0:01:47.400000
      through representing modernity, other artists made commentary about modernity
   Segment 21
      0:01:47.500000 ---> 0:01:54.100000
      in the retreat from it, looking to rural communities as a way of romanticizing
   Segment 22
      0:01:54.100000 ---> 0:02:00.100000
      what they saw as a simpler life free from the alienating effects of the modern world.
   Segment 23
      0:02:00.100000 ---> 0:02:06.200000
      One particularly common theme in Worp's Feed art, which trends toward nationalism,
   Segment 24
      0:02:06.200000 ---> 0:02:10.400000
      is its emphasis on scenes of mothers with their children.
   Segment 25
      0:02:10.400000 ---> 0:02:16.400000
      In certain contexts, this kind of imagery is sometimes referred to as pro-natalist
   Segment 26
      0:02:16.400000 ---> 0:02:22.700000
      or just natalist, meaning imagery that uses motherhood as a symbol for nation building,
   Segment 27
      0:02:22.700000 ---> 0:02:28.400000
      encouraging in this case German women to have more German children.
   Segment 28
      0:02:28.400000 ---> 0:02:33.600000
      The artist Paula Morterson Becker joined Worp's Feed in 1897.
   Segment 29
      0:02:33.600000 ---> 0:02:37.500000
      There were more opportunities for women in German art colonies
   Segment 30
      0:02:37.500000 ---> 0:02:41.700000
      versus in the more official artistic institutions.
   Segment 31
      0:02:41.700000 ---> 0:02:45.900000
      She was a member of Worp's Feed and tell her death in 1907.
   Segment 32
      0:02:45.900000 ---> 0:02:51.300000
      Her Worp's Feed paintings primarily focus on peasant women and girls.
   Segment 33
      0:02:51.300000 ---> 0:02:57.100000
      And like her peers, her work oftentimes featured pregnant or nursing mothers.
   Segment 34
      0:02:57.100000 ---> 0:03:01.200000
      Although sharing much in common with other Worp's Feed artists,
   Segment 35
      0:03:01.200000 ---> 0:03:05.700000
      her work possesses a wrongness, emotional immediacy,
   Segment 36
      0:03:05.700000 ---> 0:03:12.100000
      that has led many art historians to connect her painting style to German expressionism.
   Segment 37
      0:03:12.100000 ---> 0:03:17.300000
      The painting we're going to look at most closely for Paula Morterson Becker is this one,
   Segment 38
      0:03:17.300000 ---> 0:03:21.900000
      self-portrait on her sixth wedding anniversary from 1906.
   Segment 39
      0:03:21.900000 ---> 0:03:28.100000
      In this painting, Morterson Becker makes a self-portrait, meaning a painting of herself,
   Segment 40
      0:03:28.100000 ---> 0:03:30.900000
      in a rather unconventional state.
   Segment 41
      0:03:30.900000 ---> 0:03:37.800000
      Here she shows herself partially nude, a daring choice, and seemingly pregnant.
   Segment 42
      0:03:37.800000 ---> 0:03:39.500000
      There's a catch though.
   Segment 43
      0:03:39.600000 ---> 0:03:44.700000
      Morterson Becker was in fact not pregnant when she painted this image.
   Segment 44
      0:03:44.700000 ---> 0:03:50.800000
      There is a long-standing metaphor in Western art of referring to the art-making process
   Segment 45
      0:03:50.800000 ---> 0:03:55.600000
      as an act of making love or procreation.
   Segment 46
      0:03:55.600000 ---> 0:03:59.700000
      There is, for example, the classical tale of Pygmalion,
   Segment 47
      0:03:59.700000 ---> 0:04:05
      a story of a sculptor who made a sculpture that was so beautiful
   Segment 48
      0:04:05 ---> 0:04:09.700000
      that the artist fell in love with it as he sculpted the marble.
   Segment 49
      0:04:09.700000 ---> 0:04:16.300000
      The more he worked the stone, the more it began to soften, turning to flesh in his hands,
   Segment 50
      0:04:16.300000 ---> 0:04:20.300000
      and he ultimately fell in love with his creation.
   Segment 51
      0:04:20.300000 ---> 0:04:24.400000
      This is, I have to say, kind of a weird metaphor,
   Segment 52
      0:04:24.400000 ---> 0:04:29.600000
      in that the artist becomes both lover and father to the artwork.
   Segment 53
      0:04:29.600000 ---> 0:04:33.300000
      Here we can see another German artist named Lovis Corinth,
   Segment 54
      0:04:33.300000 ---> 0:04:38.300000
      who was one of the most influential and popular artists of the late 19th,
   Segment 55
      0:04:38.300000 ---> 0:04:40.800000
      early 20th century in Germany.
   Segment 56
      0:04:40.800000 ---> 0:04:45.800000
      And he is, it seems, thinking about this metaphor for the artist.
   Segment 57
      0:04:45.800000 ---> 0:04:51.100000
      In this self-portrait with model, we see Corinth posing with the materials
   Segment 58
      0:04:51.100000 ---> 0:04:53.300000
      from which his art is made.
   Segment 59
      0:04:53.300000 ---> 0:04:58.600000
      He has his paints, his brushes, and the model too becomes objects
   Segment 60
      0:04:58.600000 ---> 0:05:02
      through which Corinth will produce his artwork.
   Segment 61
      0:05:02 ---> 0:05:05.700000
      And Corinth in this scene is both an assumed sexual partner,
   Segment 62
      0:05:05.700000 ---> 0:05:10.200000
      and is at the same time giving life to this figure through painting her.
   Segment 63
      0:05:10.200000 ---> 0:05:17.300000
      Paula Moterson Becker's painting then may in fact be a woman's reinterpretation of this metaphor.
   Segment 64
      0:05:17.300000 ---> 0:05:21.800000
      Historically, women have often been painted as objects in Western art.
   Segment 65
      0:05:21.800000 ---> 0:05:27
      Here, Moterson Becker is both the artist and the subject matter.
   Segment 66
      0:05:27 ---> 0:05:30.200000
      She is not a distant idealized Venus.
   Segment 67
      0:05:30.200000 ---> 0:05:32.900000
      Rather, she feels vulnerable and real.
   Segment 68
      0:05:32.900000 ---> 0:05:37.100000
      In comparison to Corinth's model, whose face we do not see,
   Segment 69
      0:05:37.100000 ---> 0:05:39.800000
      who seems to possess no character of her own,
   Segment 70
      0:05:39.800000 ---> 0:05:44.500000
      Moterson Becker looks back at the viewer with an intensity.
   Segment 71
      0:05:44.500000 ---> 0:05:48
      Her expression appears curious, intelligent.
   Segment 72
      0:05:48 ---> 0:05:52.500000
      She has what we would call agency, the ability to act.
   Segment 73
      0:05:52.500000 ---> 0:05:57.100000
      While in the one hand this painting may be a meditation on her marriage
   Segment 74
      0:05:57.100000 ---> 0:05:59.300000
      and a desire to become a mother,
   Segment 75
      0:05:59.300000 ---> 0:06:04.800000
      it is likely on the other hand, a meditation on what it means to be a woman artist.
   Segment 76
      0:06:04.800000 ---> 0:06:10.500000
      During a time wherein women were more typically seen as mere objects for art,
   Segment 77
      0:06:10.500000 ---> 0:06:12.500000
      rather than its creator.
   Segment 78
      0:06:12.500000 ---> 0:06:17.900000
      Before we conclude, I wanted to talk just a bit more about this painting in terms of form.
   Segment 79
      0:06:17.900000 ---> 0:06:20.400000
      The colors appear rough and muted.
   Segment 80
      0:06:20.400000 ---> 0:06:23.800000
      The all over pattern of the background flattens the work
   Segment 81
      0:06:23.800000 ---> 0:06:27
      so that the viewer has no real sense of space,
   Segment 82
      0:06:27 ---> 0:06:29.600000
      giving the work a sort of modern quality.
   Segment 83
      0:06:29.600000 ---> 0:06:32.300000
      Looking at the figure anatomically,
   Segment 84
      0:06:32.300000 ---> 0:06:35.500000
      Moterson Becker seems to have stylized her figure
   Segment 85
      0:06:35.500000 ---> 0:06:40.700000
      with her neck sloping into her shoulders at an exaggerated angle.
   Segment 86
      0:06:40.700000 ---> 0:06:43.400000
      And yet it feels compellingly real,
   Segment 87
      0:06:43.400000 ---> 0:06:48.100000
      suggesting something of the weight and a regularity of real bodies.
   Segment 88
      0:06:48.100000 ---> 0:06:52.200000
      Her face is full of character and yet simplified,
   Segment 89
      0:06:52.200000 ---> 0:06:56.200000
      with the bridge of her nose becoming almost a flat plane.
   Segment 90
      0:06:56.200000 ---> 0:07:01.800000
      And in this way, it's sort of easy to see why art historians look at Moterson Becker's work
   Segment 91
      0:07:01.800000 ---> 0:07:05
      and see it as a pretty modernist perspective.
   Segment 92
      0:07:05 ---> 0:07:09.600000
      Sadly, Moterson Becker died a year after this was painted.
   Segment 93
      0:07:09.600000 ---> 0:07:14
      After she suffered a pulmonary embolism following childbirth,
   Segment 94
      0:07:14 ---> 0:07:18
      very likely caused by an outdated recommendation from doctors
   Segment 95
      0:07:18 ---> 0:07:23.900000
      that women should remain on strict bed rest for at least two weeks following the birth of a child.
   Segment 96
      0:07:23.900000 ---> 0:07:29.500000
      In conclusion, in the years following the formation of a unified German nation state,
   Segment 97
      0:07:29.500000 ---> 0:07:33.300000
      the art produced in Germany was increasingly nationalist.
   Segment 98
      0:07:33.300000 ---> 0:07:38.300000
      One of the forms that nationalism took was nadalist imagery,
   Segment 99
      0:07:38.300000 ---> 0:07:44.900000
      a celebration of maternal bodies as symbolic of German nation building.
   Segment 100
      0:07:44.900000 ---> 0:07:49.800000
      Vorp's feet artists, who were invested in celebrating German folk cultures,
   Segment 101
      0:07:49.800000 ---> 0:07:52.200000
      commonly employed this kind of imagery.
   Segment 102
      0:07:52.200000 ---> 0:07:57.800000
      We can, on the one hand, consider Moterson Becker's art through this lens.
   Segment 103
      0:07:57.800000 ---> 0:08:02.400000
      And, I think arguably, see something nationalist in her imagery.
   Segment 104
      0:08:02.400000 ---> 0:08:07.200000
      On the other hand, there's also something kind of radical about her artwork
   Segment 105
      0:08:07.200000 ---> 0:08:12.500000
      in the challenges that she poses to the traditional ways that women are represented.
   Segment 106
      0:08:12.500000 ---> 0:08:17.600000
      In this Frank self-portrait, Moterson Becker stands before us vulnerable,
   Segment 107
      0:08:17.600000 ---> 0:08:22.200000
      eschewing the usual authority that is the position of the artist.
   Segment 108
      0:08:22.200000 ---> 0:08:28.500000
      She perhaps makes commentary on the longstanding trope of thinking about art making
   Segment 109
      0:08:28.500000 ---> 0:08:35.100000
      as an act of procreation, in this case approaching the conceit from a woman's perspective.

Transcription for audio2.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:08
      This video will discuss the art of Elizabeth V. G. Lebron, an artist from the Rococo era in France.
   Segment 2
      0:00:08 ---> 0:00:16
      While this meme may not make sense to you just yet, hopefully you'll understand the joke by the end.
   Segment 3
      0:00:16 ---> 0:00:22
      In our conversation about V. G. Lebron, we'll be focusing in on some of her most famous images,
   Segment 4
      0:00:22 ---> 0:00:25
      her portraits of Queen Marie Antoinette.
   Segment 5
      0:00:25 ---> 0:00:29
      Marie Antoinette was the youngest daughter of Maria Teresa,
   Segment 6
      0:00:29 ---> 0:00:32
      the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire.
   Segment 7
      0:00:32 ---> 0:00:35
      She was from the powerful Habsburg line,
   Segment 8
      0:00:35 ---> 0:00:40
      and had married Louis XVI, the grandson of the son king.
   Segment 9
      0:00:40 ---> 0:00:46
      Louis XVI was even less popular than his father Louis XV had been,
   Segment 10
      0:00:46 ---> 0:00:50
      and his hold over the French populace was waning.
   Segment 11
      0:00:50 ---> 0:00:54
      His marriage to Marie Antoinette was an unpopular one,
   Segment 12
      0:00:54 ---> 0:01:00
      as the French Burbins and the Habsburgs were somewhat at odds with one another.
   Segment 13
      0:01:00 ---> 0:01:06
      In particular, Marie Antoinette was viewed by the French public as an outsider,
   Segment 14
      0:01:06 ---> 0:01:11
      though by definition most queens fit that description.
   Segment 15
      0:01:11 ---> 0:01:18
      Nonetheless, the French public had a field day caricaturing the queen and criticizing her heavy move.
   Segment 16
      0:01:18 ---> 0:01:23
      While some of this criticism was personal and we'll unpack that a bit,
   Segment 17
      0:01:23 ---> 0:01:28
      much of it stemmed from a general shift in worldviews,
   Segment 18
      0:01:28 ---> 0:01:31
      that was a byproduct of the Enlightenment era.
   Segment 19
      0:01:31 ---> 0:01:38
      The Enlightenment era was an era wherein the Western world was privileging empirical questioning,
   Segment 20
      0:01:38 ---> 0:01:42
      rationality, over strict adherence to tradition.
   Segment 21
      0:01:42 ---> 0:01:45
      This was leading to many social upheavals.
   Segment 22
      0:01:45 ---> 0:01:51
      The lower classes in France were beginning to question the long-held power structures
   Segment 23
      0:01:51 ---> 0:01:54
      that had for so long shaped their lives.
   Segment 24
      0:01:54 ---> 0:01:59
      The success of the American Revolution for independence against England
   Segment 25
      0:01:59 ---> 0:02:05
      would add fuel to the fire, as the French populace started to eye their own monarchy
   Segment 26
      0:02:05 ---> 0:02:08
      and begin planning and uprising of their own.
   Segment 27
      0:02:08 ---> 0:02:12
      But before we start talking about the specifics of the French Revolution,
   Segment 28
      0:02:12 ---> 0:02:15
      which kicked off officially in 1789,
   Segment 29
      0:02:15 ---> 0:02:20
      let's take a step back and think a bit about these portraits of Marie Antoinette
   Segment 30
      0:02:20 ---> 0:02:22
      by the artist, Vijay Lebron.
   Segment 31
      0:02:22 ---> 0:02:26
      Vijay Lebron was a prominent portraitist of her day.
   Segment 32
      0:02:26 ---> 0:02:33
      She was one of only 15 women who were accepted as members of the French Painting Academy.
   Segment 33
      0:02:33 ---> 0:02:37
      She attracted the attention of the Queen Marie Antoinette,
   Segment 34
      0:02:37 ---> 0:02:41
      who hired her as her official court painter,
   Segment 35
      0:02:41 ---> 0:02:47
      becoming her portraitist and confidant during those years, leading up to the Revolution.
   Segment 36
      0:02:47 ---> 0:02:52
      The painting on the left that depicts Marie Antoinette on Chameez
   Segment 37
      0:02:52 ---> 0:02:54
      is among her most famous.
   Segment 38
      0:02:54 ---> 0:03:01
      In this image, we see Marie Antoinette in what is essentially a fancy house dress
   Segment 39
      0:03:01 ---> 0:03:05
      and a gardening hat, making what is known as a nose gay.
   Segment 40
      0:03:05 ---> 0:03:12
      A nose gay is a small bouquet of flowers that in the 18th century was oftentimes given
   Segment 41
      0:03:12 ---> 0:03:17
      as a gift from one woman to another woman as a sign of friendship.
   Segment 42
      0:03:17 ---> 0:03:22
      What's interesting about this painting is that we have a woman artist, Vijay Lebron,
   Segment 43
      0:03:22 ---> 0:03:29
      depicting another woman, Marie Antoinette, who was holding a gift that would undoubtedly be intended
   Segment 44
      0:03:29 ---> 0:03:31
      as a sign of affection between women.
   Segment 45
      0:03:31 ---> 0:03:36
      In other words, whereas most Western paintings during this time
   Segment 46
      0:03:36 ---> 0:03:41
      tend to assume that their audience is primarily comprised of men,
   Segment 47
      0:03:41 ---> 0:03:46
      here, the imagined ideal viewer is probably in fact a woman, right?
   Segment 48
      0:03:46 ---> 0:03:51
      Marie Antoinette looks out at us affectionately as if she's about to infect,
   Segment 49
      0:03:51 ---> 0:03:56
      hand us the nose gay, that she is adorning with ribbon.
   Segment 50
      0:03:56 ---> 0:04:01
      According to Mary Sheriff, the historian of 18th century art,
   Segment 51
      0:04:01 ---> 0:04:09
      this painting in many ways encapsulates the criticism that the French populace levied against the Queen.
   Segment 52
      0:04:09 ---> 0:04:16
      Here we see the Queen depicted in an attire deemed unsuitable for public viewership.
   Segment 53
      0:04:16 ---> 0:04:23
      Although to modernize appearing quite covered up, this was seen as the equivalent of seeing the Queen in Negligé.
   Segment 54
      0:04:23 ---> 0:04:30
      Moreover, many French citizens worried that Marie Antoinette was too independent,
   Segment 55
      0:04:30 ---> 0:04:35
      acting too separately from her husband, throwing lavish parties for herself,
   Segment 56
      0:04:35 ---> 0:04:38
      her large female retinue.
   Segment 57
      0:04:38 ---> 0:04:44
      Rumors swirled around Marie Antoinette that there were in fact sapphic happenings,
   Segment 58
      0:04:44 ---> 0:04:47
      taking place beyond the palace walls.
   Segment 59
      0:04:47 ---> 0:04:52
      The painting on the right, Portrait of Marie Antoinette with children,
   Segment 60
      0:04:52 ---> 0:04:57
      is essentially a propagandistic response to this criticism.
   Segment 61
      0:04:57 ---> 0:05:03
      In this large format painting, we see Marie Antoinette seated with her children.
   Segment 62
      0:05:03 ---> 0:05:12
      Her child on her lap would have created a familiar resonance with depictions of the Madonna and Child in the Christian tradition,
   Segment 63
      0:05:12 ---> 0:05:15
      aligning her with her Catholic upbringing.
   Segment 64
      0:05:15 ---> 0:05:21
      Here, rather than being shown alone in the implied company of female friends,
   Segment 65
      0:05:21 ---> 0:05:24
      she's being shown as an ideal mother.
   Segment 66
      0:05:24 ---> 0:05:29
      Safely in the domestic interior, her daughter affectionately clinging to her arm.
   Segment 67
      0:05:29 ---> 0:05:38
      No longer dressed on chemise, here she's dressed regally, formally, in a way that is more befitting a queen.
   Segment 68
      0:05:38 ---> 0:05:44
      To her side, we see an empty bassinet, with dark blue fabric hanging slightly over it.
   Segment 69
      0:05:44 ---> 0:05:50
      This empty bassinet was intended to pull at the heartstrings of French viewers,
   Segment 70
      0:05:50 ---> 0:05:55
      in that it reminds viewers of Marie Antoinette's miscarriage.
   Segment 71
      0:05:55 ---> 0:06:01
      Above eyeline, partly hidden in the shadows, we see a partial image of the king's crown.
   Segment 72
      0:06:01 ---> 0:06:07
      This was likely intended to suggest to viewers that even though he is not physically present,
   Segment 73
      0:06:07 ---> 0:06:13
      the queen is nonetheless beholden to his power, not acting independently,
   Segment 74
      0:06:13 ---> 0:06:17
      not moving outside of his circle of influence.
   Segment 75
      0:06:17 ---> 0:06:24
      Nonetheless, images like this one did little to Aswaj, the nation's criticisms.
   Segment 76
      0:06:24 ---> 0:06:29
      The French public mocked the extravagance of Marie Antoinette's attire,
   Segment 77
      0:06:29 ---> 0:06:36
      and even accused Marie Antoinette of not seeming appropriately sad in this depiction,
   Segment 78
      0:06:36 ---> 0:06:40
      painted just two years before the French Revolution begins.
   Segment 79
      0:06:40 ---> 0:06:48
      This effort, to change the queen's public perception, ultimately fell on unbending ears.
   Segment 80
      0:06:48 ---> 0:06:53
      In July of 1789, the French Revolution officially began.
   Segment 81
      0:06:53 ---> 0:06:58
      The event that punctuated its beginning was the storming of the Bastille.
   Segment 82
      0:06:58 ---> 0:07:06
      The Bastille was a long-standing, monarchical prison that held at this time only a small handful of prisoners.
   Segment 83
      0:07:06 ---> 0:07:11
      And therefore, this event was more symbolic than necessarily consequential.
   Segment 84
      0:07:12 ---> 0:07:18
      Nonetheless, in the years that followed, the French public successfully overthrew the monarchy
   Segment 85
      0:07:18 ---> 0:07:22
      and the aristocracy that supported it.
   Segment 86
      0:07:22 ---> 0:07:29
      And many of those who had previously held great power within society, such as Louis XVI
   Segment 87
      0:07:29 ---> 0:07:33
      and Marie Antoinette, of course, met their fate at the guillotine.
   Segment 88
      0:07:33 ---> 0:07:38
      Here we see a depiction of Marie Antoinette waiting for her execution
   Segment 89
      0:07:38 ---> 0:07:42
      by the neoclassical painter Jacques-Louis David.
   Segment 90
      0:07:42 ---> 0:07:51
      Whatever one might think about Marie Antoinette, and certainly she benefited from oppressive class politics,
   Segment 91
      0:07:51 ---> 0:08:00
      it is nonetheless worth considering for a moment the way that misogyny has shaped the discussion of her images.
   Segment 92
      0:08:00 ---> 0:08:06
      Marie Antoinette was an influential woman who used her influence to promote the success of other women.
   Segment 93
      0:08:06 ---> 0:08:11
      She chose V.G. Lebron as her court painter, assuring her art world success.
   Segment 94
      0:08:11 ---> 0:08:18
      V.G. Lebron in turn painted many grand and exquisitely rendered portraits of Marie Antoinette,
   Segment 95
      0:08:18 ---> 0:08:22
      some of which, like this one, were quite daring for the time.
   Segment 96
      0:08:22 ---> 0:08:28
      However, many art historians declared this quick sketch by Jacques-Louis David
   Segment 97
      0:08:28 ---> 0:08:32
      to be the ultimate portrait of Marie Antoinette,
   Segment 98
      0:08:32 ---> 0:08:36
      a portrait that spoke of the genius of the artist.
   Segment 99
      0:08:36 ---> 0:08:40
      The art historian Mary Sheriff mentioned earlier in this video,
   Segment 100
      0:08:40 ---> 0:08:48
      along with several other art historians, have argued that this privileging of Jacques-Louis David's portrait of Marie Antoinette
   Segment 101
      0:08:48 ---> 0:08:54
      over those painted by V.G. Lebron, as well as the wholesale rejection of the Rocco Coe
   Segment 102
      0:08:54 ---> 0:09:01
      as a style worth consideration, may in fact amount to a prejudice within the art history
   Segment 103
      0:09:01 ---> 0:09:10
      discipline itself toward viewing men artists as capable of genius in ways that women artists are held separate from.
   Segment 104
      0:09:10 ---> 0:09:18
      There is something somewhat disturbing about viewing this image of a woman at her lowest point,
   Segment 105
      0:09:18 ---> 0:09:25
      her most vulnerable, a moment of humiliation and corporal punishment as the ultimate
   Segment 106
      0:09:25 ---> 0:09:29
      and most true depiction of her identity.
   Segment 107
      0:09:30 ---> 0:09:34
      Ultimately, Elizabeth V.G. Lebron escaped the guillotine.
   Segment 108
      0:09:34 ---> 0:09:43
      During the revolution, she self-exiled to Florence, where she continued to paint and taught her craft to others.
   Segment 109
      0:09:43 ---> 0:09:50
      In conclusion, V.G. Lebron was a prominent artist during the French Rocco Coe era
   Segment 110
      0:09:50 ---> 0:09:53
      in the years leading up to the French Revolution.
   Segment 111
      0:09:53 ---> 0:10:01
      She was the court painter to Marie Antoinette and painted many portraits of the unpopular queen in different guises.
   Segment 112
      0:10:01 ---> 0:10:12
      Some of her pictures are rather intimate, like this one, on Chimes, whereas others serve more obviously propagandistic goals.
   Segment 113
      0:10:12 ---> 0:10:19
      Ultimately, those propagandistic images did little to change the feeling of the French public,
   Segment 114
      0:10:19 ---> 0:10:26
      which was concerned with Marie Antoinette's independence and potentially lesbian leanings,
   Segment 115
      0:10:26 ---> 0:10:35
      and was also inspired by Enlightenment-era thought, which encouraged criticism toward long-established tradition, such as the monarchy.
   Segment 116
      0:10:35 ---> 0:10:42
      The French Revolution began in 1789 and altered the course of French history thereafter.

      In this video, we will be discussing Lily Martin Spencer's Kiss Me and You'll Kiss
   Segment 2
      0:00:05.680000 ---> 0:00:13.160000
      the Lassus. Most genre paintings in 19th century US, genre paintings being images
   Segment 3
      0:00:13.160000 ---> 0:00:18.080000
      that show mundane everyday moments, generally centered the experience of
   Segment 4
      0:00:18.080000 ---> 0:00:23.880000
      white men. Women were rarely depicted as main characters within the drama and
   Segment 5
      0:00:23.880000 ---> 0:00:29.920000
      were instead usually relegated to the literal sidelines, the margins of the
   Segment 6
      0:00:29.920000 ---> 0:00:36.280000
      canvas. The art of Lily Martin Spencer, however, is different. I want to take a
   Segment 7
      0:00:36.280000 ---> 0:00:42.120000
      moment here to say a word about women artists in the 19th century. Great or
   Segment 8
      0:00:42.120000 ---> 0:00:48.360000
      even good art historically comes from great opportunity. White women and black
   Segment 9
      0:00:48.360000 ---> 0:00:53.760000
      Americans were typically excluded from any form of formal training in the arts
   Segment 10
      0:00:53.760000 ---> 0:00:58.640000
      in the United States until the later half of the 19th century. They were not
   Segment 11
      0:00:58.680000 ---> 0:01:02.960000
      permitted to study anatomy in the traditional way, forbidden from participating
   Segment 12
      0:01:02.960000 ---> 0:01:09.160000
      in new drawing or witnessing dissection. In addition to this, women artists faced
   Segment 13
      0:01:09.160000 ---> 0:01:15.160000
      social derision. They were regarded as aberrations and most were forced to
   Segment 14
      0:01:15.160000 ---> 0:01:20.440000
      choose between being a professional and having a family. On the far right, we see
   Segment 15
      0:01:20.440000 ---> 0:01:25.680000
      a cartoon by the French comic Domier that shows a woman writer sneering at her
   Segment 16
      0:01:25.680000 ---> 0:01:31.120000
      husband to remove her crying child from her sight. Women with ambition beyond
   Segment 17
      0:01:31.120000 ---> 0:01:37.760000
      family were aggressively stereotyped as unfeminine and terrible mothers. The
   Segment 18
      0:01:37.760000 ---> 0:01:42.560000
      Martins, however, were quite progressive for their era. Lily's parents raised
   Segment 19
      0:01:42.560000 ---> 0:01:47.920000
      their daughters in a similar respect to their sons, encouraging them to pursue
   Segment 20
      0:01:47.920000 ---> 0:01:54.560000
      their professional passions. Moreover, Benjamin Spencer, Lily's husband, gave up
   Segment 21
      0:01:54.560000 ---> 0:02:00.080000
      his tailoring trade to care for their children and run the household. In her
   Segment 22
      0:02:00.080000 ---> 0:02:06.040000
      painting titled Young Husband First Marketing from 1854, she affectionately
   Segment 23
      0:02:06.040000 ---> 0:02:11.960000
      depicts a young man who appears a bit out of his depth, aiding in a task that
   Segment 24
      0:02:11.960000 ---> 0:02:18.200000
      was typically stereotyped as women's work. Thus, blessed with extraordinary and
   Segment 25
      0:02:18.200000 ---> 0:02:24.520000
      uncommon familial support, Lily Martin Spencer was able to push through the
   Segment 26
      0:02:24.560000 ---> 0:02:29.440000
      boundaries that society had set for her and for other women and became a
   Segment 27
      0:02:29.440000 ---> 0:02:35.040000
      successful working artist. Spencer's genre paintings largely focused on happy
   Segment 28
      0:02:35.040000 ---> 0:02:40.880000
      domestic scenes, warm images of women and their children. Her work is typically
   Segment 29
      0:02:40.880000 ---> 0:02:47.720000
      quite positive with no serious drama or tragedy. Okay, now I realize that these
   Segment 30
      0:02:47.720000 ---> 0:02:53.120000
      are very different paintings, but I want to exaggerate a point here by showing
   Segment 31
      0:02:53.120000 ---> 0:02:58.640000
      two images of women painted by American artists in the 19th century. Looking
   Segment 32
      0:02:58.640000 ---> 0:03:03.800000
      quickly at John Vanderlin's Ariadne asleep, we can see a nude woman lying
   Segment 33
      0:03:03.800000 ---> 0:03:08.800000
      recumbent in the grass. She's a figure from classical mythology, not a
   Segment 34
      0:03:08.800000 ---> 0:03:14.440000
      contemporary American citizen. So her nudity feels eternal, somehow
   Segment 35
      0:03:14.440000 ---> 0:03:20.200000
      chastened by the distance of time. Ariadne is asleep and is unaware of our
   Segment 36
      0:03:20.240000 ---> 0:03:25.040000
      presence without the threat of her looking back, which might make us feel a
   Segment 37
      0:03:25.040000 ---> 0:03:32.280000
      bit guilty or implicated. In art history, we talk a lot about the gaze, G-A-Z-E, and
   Segment 38
      0:03:32.280000 ---> 0:03:39.240000
      the gaze describes the way looking at art sometimes conveys power. Sometimes
   Segment 39
      0:03:39.240000 ---> 0:03:44.480000
      that means that we the viewers hold the gaze, we hold power over the figure in
   Segment 40
      0:03:44.480000 ---> 0:03:50
      the scene, as in Vanderlin's painting. But in Spencer's Kiss Me, our main
   Segment 41
      0:03:50 ---> 0:03:56.440000
      character gazes back. She feels like our equal. Another term we might use to
   Segment 42
      0:03:56.440000 ---> 0:04:02.640000
      describe this is agency. Agency describes an individual's capacity to act.
   Segment 43
      0:04:02.640000 ---> 0:04:07.960000
      Whereas Vanderlin's figure does not feel like an agent, does not feel like an
   Segment 44
      0:04:07.960000 ---> 0:04:13.200000
      individual with the potential to act in this scene. Spencer's woman looks out at
   Segment 45
      0:04:13.200000 ---> 0:04:18.960000
      us with an awareness in her eyes, a coy intelligence, a flirtatious wit. She
   Segment 46
      0:04:18.960000 ---> 0:04:24.200000
      stands inside a middle-class household surrounded by a bounty of fruit, and her
   Segment 47
      0:04:24.200000 ---> 0:04:29.720000
      clothing suggests that she is the lady of the house. She turns to us, the viewer, an
   Segment 48
      0:04:29.720000 ---> 0:04:36.840000
      interloper, her husband perhaps, and interacts with us warmly. The title implies
   Segment 49
      0:04:36.840000 ---> 0:04:42.560000
      playful, albeit threatening flirtation. If you dare kiss her, you'll be kissing the
   Segment 50
      0:04:42.600000 ---> 0:04:47.600000
      hot molasses in her spoon. With her disarming smile, however, we don't really
   Segment 51
      0:04:47.600000 ---> 0:04:53
      believe her threat. She seems happy to see us, and is an agent confidently
   Segment 52
      0:04:53 ---> 0:04:58.560000
      wielding her own sexuality. Pleasure is not taken from her, as in a sleeping
   Segment 53
      0:04:58.560000 ---> 0:05:04.720000
      nude, rather pleasure in this case is mutual and affectionate. In some ways,
   Segment 54
      0:05:04.720000 ---> 0:05:10.720000
      this painting is quite in line with 19th century norms surrounding gender. Our
   Segment 55
      0:05:10.760000 ---> 0:05:15.840000
      main character is situated within a conventional domestic scene. She's cooking,
   Segment 56
      0:05:15.840000 ---> 0:05:21.040000
      traditionally associated with women. She is surrounded by fruit and flowers,
   Segment 57
      0:05:21.040000 ---> 0:05:27.240000
      which, sent time immemorial, have been used in Western art as a symbol for natural
   Segment 58
      0:05:27.240000 ---> 0:05:34.640000
      fertility. Like the fruit, she is ripe for the plucking. Just a funny side note, the
   Segment 59
      0:05:34.680000 ---> 0:05:39.840000
      feminist art historian Linda Noklin actually parodied the stereotype in the
   Segment 60
      0:05:39.840000 ---> 0:05:46.320000
      1970s. She purchased this vintage erotic postcard on the left, which was titled
   Segment 61
      0:05:46.320000 ---> 0:05:52.600000
      By My Apples, from a second hand shop. The joke being here that her breasts are
   Segment 62
      0:05:52.600000 ---> 0:05:58.640000
      also resting on the tray, creating a visual juxtaposition. In Noklin's
   Segment 63
      0:05:58.640000 ---> 0:06:03.600000
      version, we see a model holding a tray of bananas, lowering it down in order to
   Segment 64
      0:06:03.600000 ---> 0:06:08.560000
      hear, make another clear visual juxtaposition between the fruit and the
   Segment 65
      0:06:08.560000 ---> 0:06:14
      exposed fallis. All that said, although Spencer's paintings are somewhat
   Segment 66
      0:06:14 ---> 0:06:19.560000
      conventional in a few ways, in their domestic setting, in the typical connection
   Segment 67
      0:06:19.560000 ---> 0:06:25.440000
      between women and fruit, the women in her paintings also act with a boldness and
   Segment 68
      0:06:25.440000 ---> 0:06:31.760000
      autonomy, not typically afforded to women in art of that day. Moreover, it was
   Segment 69
      0:06:31.800000 ---> 0:06:35.600000
      actually pretty uncommon to see a depiction of a middle-class woman
   Segment 70
      0:06:35.600000 ---> 0:06:41.280000
      participating in labor. She is confident, capable, active, and in control of her
   Segment 71
      0:06:41.280000 ---> 0:06:46.760000
      own world, even if it's a limited one. Throughout her career, Spencer worked
   Segment 72
      0:06:46.760000 ---> 0:06:51.800000
      with print companies such as the Cosmopolitan Art Association, which
   Segment 73
      0:06:51.800000 ---> 0:06:56.040000
      commissioned artists to make paintings that could be turned into reproducible
   Segment 74
      0:06:56.040000 ---> 0:07:01.800000
      prints. These prints could then be sold off to middle-class buyers, who could
   Segment 75
      0:07:01.800000 ---> 0:07:07.600000
      also choose to become subscribers to an ongoing print service. Spencer's works
   Segment 76
      0:07:07.600000 ---> 0:07:13.680000
      were markedly successful, selling as many as an estimated million lithographs of
   Segment 77
      0:07:13.680000 ---> 0:07:20
      her various scenes. However, there was always a harsh disparity between her
   Segment 78
      0:07:20 ---> 0:07:26.520000
      mass popularity and her actual financial circumstances. Spencer struggled to make
   Segment 79
      0:07:26.520000 ---> 0:07:31.560000
      a living as a professional painter, and her family lived in a constant state of
   Segment 80
      0:07:31.560000 ---> 0:07:37.200000
      near poverty, as she only received a very small portion of the profit from the
   Segment 81
      0:07:37.200000 ---> 0:07:42.360000
      sales. Just so we don't end on that note, I'll tell you that despite these
   Segment 82
      0:07:42.360000 ---> 0:07:47.480000
      struggles, despite the social obstacles that rendered her unconventional career
   Segment 83
      0:07:47.480000 ---> 0:07:53.840000
      more difficult, Lily Martin Spencer, by all accounts, was happy. In conclusion,
   Segment 84
      0:07:53.840000 ---> 0:07:59
      most US genre paintings of the 19th century center the experience of white
   Segment 85
      0:07:59 ---> 0:08:04.280000
      men. In contrast, Lily Martin Spencer's protagonists were often white women. In
   Segment 86
      0:08:04.280000 ---> 0:08:09.740000
      Kiss Me and You'll Kiss the Lasses, we see a woman who is in control of her
   Segment 87
      0:08:09.740000 ---> 0:08:15.200000
      environment. She is an agent with the capacity to act. She gazes flirtatiously
   Segment 88
      0:08:15.360000 ---> 0:08:20.120000
      out at us, as if greeting her partner who teasingly distracts her from her work.
   Segment 89
      0:08:20.120000 ---> 0:08:25.560000
      Paintings like this one were created with the intention of being mass produced as
   Segment 90
      0:08:25.560000 ---> 0:08:31.640000
      prints, suggesting that they had popular appeal. Indeed, prints of her imagery sold
   Segment 91
      0:08:31.640000 ---> 0:08:38.040000
      well, but Spencer nonetheless struggled financially, perhaps exacerbated by art
   Segment 92
      0:08:38.040000 ---> 0:08:41.760000
      world biases against women.

      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:05.200000
      In this video, we're going to be discussing the scientific photography of Anna Adkins,
   Segment 2
      0:00:05.200000 ---> 0:00:10.880000
      the first woman photographer. In lieu of a meme, this is actually a Google Doodle that was dedicated
   Segment 3
      0:00:10.880000 ---> 0:00:18.160000
      to Adkins and her work. After De Geres unveiling a photography in the late 1830s, photography was
   Segment 4
      0:00:18.160000 ---> 0:00:24.880000
      almost immediately put to use for scientific pursuits. Edding House, for example, was a Viennese
   Segment 5
      0:00:24.960000 ---> 0:00:31.520000
      physicist who in fact witnessed De Geres presentation and thereafter began experimenting
   Segment 6
      0:00:31.520000 ---> 0:00:38.240000
      with photographing microscopic cross-sections of cells. Although stars were too faint for
   Segment 7
      0:00:38.240000 ---> 0:00:43.920000
      photographers to yet capture, early photographers managed to successfully take photographs of the
   Segment 8
      0:00:43.920000 ---> 0:00:51.200000
      moon. Here's a series of De Geres types taken of an eclipse made by a Philadelphia camera dealer,
   Segment 9
      0:00:51.200000 ---> 0:00:57.200000
      perhaps intended as a way of demonstrating the potential of this new medium, what their product
   Segment 10
      0:00:57.200000 ---> 0:01:04.320000
      could do. Today, one of the better-known figures who engaged in early scientific photography was

      0:01:04.320000 ---> 0:01:11.440000
      Anna Adkins. Adkins was not first and foremost an artist, but again, a scientist. In this case,
   Segment 12
      0:01:11.440000 ---> 0:01:17.040000
      she was an English botanist. For the most part, women were heavily excluded from the field of
   Segment 13
      0:01:17.040000 ---> 0:01:23.840000
      science in the 19th century. Botany, however, was an exception. Upper-class women in England
   Segment 14
      0:01:23.840000 ---> 0:01:29.760000
      were in fact encouraged to pursue botany in an amateur capacity, as it was seen as a science
   Segment 15
      0:01:29.760000 ---> 0:01:36.960000
      more appropriate to women. Adkins was interested in science, and she chose to pursue the avenue
   Segment 16
      0:01:36.960000 ---> 0:01:42.960000
      that was most available to her as a woman. Growing up, Adkins was very close to her father.
   Segment 17
      0:01:43.040000 ---> 0:01:48.400000
      Her mother had died when she was still fairly young, and happily, her father encouraged her
   Segment 18
      0:01:48.400000 ---> 0:01:54.400000
      professional pursuits. He was unusually progressive for the era, and believed that his daughter could
   Segment 19
      0:01:54.400000 ---> 0:02:00.880000
      do anything that a son could. He was a scientist in the English Royal Society, and helped Adkins
   Segment 20
      0:02:00.880000 ---> 0:02:07.200000
      to make advantageous connections with others in the science community. Arguably, the most important
   Segment 21
      0:02:07.200000 ---> 0:02:12.560000
      connection was with a man named Herschel, who is an astronomer and an early photographer,
   Segment 22
      0:02:12.560000 ---> 0:02:18.080000
      who had invented a new type of photogram. As a reminder, photograms are a type of photography
   Segment 23
      0:02:18.080000 ---> 0:02:24.480000
      that involves making light-sensitive paper and then placing objects on top of it, exposing that
   Segment 24
      0:02:24.480000 ---> 0:02:30.960000
      to the sunlight, then removing those objects, leaving a negative image of the objects where the
   Segment 25
      0:02:30.960000 ---> 0:02:37.360000
      son did not reach the paper. Rather than employing silver nitrates, Herschel used iron,
   Segment 26
      0:02:37.360000 ---> 0:02:44.320000
      resulting in a blue color rather than the normal gray scale. In addition to inventing the cyanotype,
   Segment 27
      0:02:44.320000 ---> 0:02:50.720000
      by the way, Herschel, in fact, coined the terms negative, positive, and snapshot as they applied
   Segment 28
      0:02:50.720000 ---> 0:02:58.480000
      to photography. Adkins and Herschel became friends in the early 1840s, and she soon thereafter began
   Segment 29
      0:02:58.480000 ---> 0:03:04.960000
      creating cyanotype photographs from her extensive specimen collection of Fern's algae and other
   Segment 30
      0:03:04.960000 ---> 0:03:12.240000
      plants. Having begun creating these photographs in the 1840s, Adkins is considered the first
   Segment 31
      0:03:12.240000 ---> 0:03:18.160000
      woman photographer. She was also the first to create a commercially produced, photographically
   Segment 32
      0:03:18.160000 ---> 0:03:26.320000
      illustrated book. The books produced by Adkins included pages of artfully arranged plant material
   Segment 33
      0:03:26.320000 ---> 0:03:32.240000
      with delicate script. Each interior page was labeled at the bottom with the Latin name of the
   Segment 34
      0:03:32.240000 ---> 0:03:39.680000
      plant depicted. She printed these images on high-quality paper, and although scientific, they're thoughtfully
   Segment 35
      0:03:39.680000 ---> 0:03:48.080000
      composed and striking images. Adkins became quite adept at knowing precisely how long her exposure
   Segment 36
      0:03:48.080000 ---> 0:03:54.240000
      time needed to be during specific times of the day and specific light conditions, so that her
   Segment 37
      0:03:54.240000 ---> 0:04:02.240000
      images would come out as clear as possible. Reproducing these volumes was no easy task.
   Segment 38
      0:04:02.960000 ---> 0:04:10.800000
      These cyanotypes were one-of-a-kind, not easily reproducible, and therefore, Adkins had to painstakingly
   Segment 39
      0:04:10.800000 ---> 0:04:18.160000
      arrange each page anew, meaning that each volume was slightly different from the next. This was
   Segment 40
      0:04:18.240000 ---> 0:04:24.800000
      very time-consuming. Each book was produced in a bespoke manner, and therefore, this was a very
   Segment 41
      0:04:24.800000 ---> 0:04:31.680000
      limited run, and the books were mostly reserved for friends and close colleagues. Photography
   Segment 42
      0:04:31.680000 ---> 0:04:39.920000
      was a brand new field, and the possibilities for its use felt wide open. And scientists
   Segment 43
      0:04:39.920000 ---> 0:04:46.800000
      immediately recognized its potential as a means of documenting physical phenomena. In fact,
   Segment 44
      0:04:46.800000 ---> 0:04:54
      photography took off in practical fields like science and simple portraiture well before it was
   Segment 45
      0:04:54 ---> 0:05:01.280000
      established as a set art form. The fact that photography was a brand new field also meant that it was
   Segment 46
      0:05:01.280000 ---> 0:05:08.880000
      more wide open socially, whereas many fields had already been established and norms had been affixed
   Segment 47
      0:05:08.880000 ---> 0:05:16.160000
      to them. Photography was fluid. It had not yet been, for example, stereotyped as a man's profession.
   Segment 48
      0:05:16.960000 ---> 0:05:23.120000
      It is therefore likely for that reason that many women were able to successfully enter into
   Segment 49
      0:05:23.120000 ---> 0:05:29.360000
      photography in the 19th century in relatively large numbers compared to other professions.
   Segment 50
      0:05:30.080000 ---> 0:05:35.360000
      Likewise, it is known that several black Americans also found success in this field.
   Segment 51
      0:05:35.920000 ---> 0:05:42.160000
      It was a wide open market, and many savvy entrepreneurs seized upon this opportunity to get in on the
   Segment 52
      0:05:42.160000 ---> 0:05:48.800000
      ground level. In conclusion, almost immediately after the technology of photography was unveiled,
   Segment 53
      0:05:49.440000 ---> 0:05:56.800000
      it began being put to use for scientific pursuits. One of those early scientific photographers was
   Segment 54
      0:05:56.800000 ---> 0:06:03.520000
      Anna Adkins, who was also the first woman photographer. Her botany-related cyanotypes
   Segment 55
      0:06:03.520000 ---> 0:06:09.760000
      functioned as aids in the study of plant life, but they were also artfully arranged, quite beautiful
   Segment 56
      0:06:09.760000 ---> 0:06:15.440000
      in their own right, as Adkins had mastered the art of cyanotype photographs, exploiting it to
   Segment 57
      0:06:15.440000 ---> 0:06:22.400000
      its highest potential. She produced a limited run of volumes, depicting examples from her multiple
   Segment 58
      0:06:22.400000 ---> 0:06:28.560000
      collections of plant life. And through the reproduction of these volumes, Adkins became the first
   Segment 59
      0:06:28.560000 ---> 0:06:35.360000
      photographer to create a photographically illustrated book for distribution, albeit limited. The field
   Segment 60
      0:06:35.360000 ---> 0:06:41.920000
      of photography seemed wide open, and society was negotiating and debating just what its functions
   Segment 61
      0:06:41.920000 ---> 0:06:49.200000
      might be, but certainly science seemed to be one of them. Moreover, because the field was only just
   Segment 62
      0:06:49.200000 ---> 0:06:56
      beginning, society had not yet established cultural norms that dictated who could and could not be a
   Segment 63
      0:06:56 ---> 0:07:02.720000
      photographer. Therefore, it was a field that, quite early on, became a professional refuge for both
   Segment 64
      0:07:02.720000 ---> 0:07:05.520000
      women and racial minorities.

Transcription for audio5.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:04.800000
      In this video, we will discuss Rosa Bonner's The Horse Fair.
   Segment 2
      0:00:04.800000 ---> 0:00:12.100000
      Though her art was highly esteemed during her lifetime, later art historians long dismissed
   Segment 3
      0:00:12.100000 ---> 0:00:18.640000
      Rosa Bonner as someone who lived an interesting life, but whose work consisted only of boring
   Segment 4
      0:00:18.640000 ---> 0:00:20.640000
      animal paintings.
   Segment 5
      0:00:20.640000 ---> 0:00:27.640000
      However, despite this shaky reception after her death, she was hands down one of the most
   Segment 6
      0:00:27.640000 ---> 0:00:33.280000
      successful women artists of the 19th century, and was up for the title of most celebrated
   Segment 7
      0:00:33.280000 ---> 0:00:36.340000
      animal painter Point Blank.
   Segment 8
      0:00:36.340000 ---> 0:00:41.800000
      Rather than being some small-time subject matter, animal painting was actually a favored
   Segment 9
      0:00:41.800000 ---> 0:00:46.640000
      category of the day, overlapping quite a lot with French realism.
   Segment 10
      0:00:46.640000 ---> 0:00:52.840000
      Additionally, Bonner was the first woman artist to receive the French Legion of Honor in the
   Segment 11
      0:00:53.560000 ---> 0:01:00.240000
      Horse Fair, her best-known painting, generated endless laudatory reviews upon its debut at
   Segment 12
      0:01:00.240000 ---> 0:01:03.880000
      the Paris Salon of 1853.
   Segment 13
      0:01:03.880000 ---> 0:01:08.640000
      During the 19th century, it was exceedingly difficult for women to become professional
   Segment 14
      0:01:08.640000 ---> 0:01:15.080000
      artists, but her father, a painter himself, held radically feminist views for the time
   Segment 15
      0:01:15.080000 ---> 0:01:16.180000
      period.
   Segment 16
      0:01:16.180000 ---> 0:01:21.680000
      He supported her education both in art but also in animal studies.
   Segment 17
      0:01:21.680000 ---> 0:01:27.720000
      Bonner, in fact, attended animal anatomy courses at the Paris Veterinary Institute,
   Segment 18
      0:01:27.720000 ---> 0:01:32.840000
      even participating in animal dissections, which were typically reserved only for male
   Segment 19
      0:01:32.840000 ---> 0:01:34.800000
      students.
   Segment 20
      0:01:34.800000 ---> 0:01:41.040000
      She lived a highly unconventional life for a woman of her day, to say the least.
   Segment 21
      0:01:41.040000 ---> 0:01:46.520000
      Because she so often painted in stockyards, a space occupied solely by men, she was able
   Segment 22
      0:01:46.520000 ---> 0:01:52.440000
      to successfully seek special dispensation from the French government to dress in pants,
   Segment 23
      0:01:52.440000 ---> 0:01:56.880000
      allowing her to better fit in and avoid harassment.
   Segment 24
      0:01:56.880000 ---> 0:02:03.480000
      And it was also just more practical for trudging around through muddy landscapes and such.
   Segment 25
      0:02:03.480000 ---> 0:02:09.520000
      This dispensation, ridiculously enough, required special paperwork that she in fact had to
   Segment 26
      0:02:09.520000 ---> 0:02:12.320000
      renew every six months.
   Segment 27
      0:02:12.320000 ---> 0:02:15
      Imagine not being able to wear pants.
   Segment 28
      0:02:15 ---> 0:02:21.600000
      Additionally, Bonner wore her hair cropped in a bob, and often donned a fedora.
   Segment 29
      0:02:21.600000 ---> 0:02:27.640000
      While to the French public, Bonner claimed that this attire was a matter of mere convenience,
   Segment 30
      0:02:27.640000 ---> 0:02:31.120000
      she wore these clothes in almost all circumstances.
   Segment 31
      0:02:31.120000 ---> 0:02:37.200000
      So her historians in hindsight believe that this dispensation also enabled Bonner to live
   Segment 32
      0:02:37.200000 ---> 0:02:41.440000
      more authentically in line with her gender identity.
   Segment 33
      0:02:41.440000 ---> 0:02:44.160000
      More on this in a little bit.
   Segment 34
      0:02:44.160000 ---> 0:02:50.560000
      The horse fare is a massive wall-sized painting, of a market located in the center of Paris,
   Segment 35
      0:02:50.560000 ---> 0:02:53.640000
      where animals are shown and sold.
   Segment 36
      0:02:53.640000 ---> 0:02:59.480000
      The painting is characterized by buzzing, churning excitement and action.
   Segment 37
      0:02:59.480000 ---> 0:03:03.120000
      The horses buck and resist their keepers.
   Segment 38
      0:03:03.120000 ---> 0:03:08.520000
      In contrast to other animal painters of the day, she tended to imbue the animals in her
   Segment 39
      0:03:08.520000 ---> 0:03:12.080000
      paintings with individuality and power.
   Segment 40
      0:03:12.080000 ---> 0:03:18.200000
      Often, as we can see here, the animals seem to physically overwhelm the humans in the
   Segment 41
      0:03:18.200000 ---> 0:03:19.200000
      scene.
   Segment 42
      0:03:19.200000 ---> 0:03:21.920000
      They're much larger proportionally.
   Segment 43
      0:03:21.920000 ---> 0:03:27.640000
      While some art historians used to see her art as straightforward, uncomplicated, and even
   Segment 44
      0:03:27.640000 ---> 0:03:35.280000
      boring in comparison to the burgeoning modernism of, say, Courbet or Menet, art historians today
   Segment 45
      0:03:35.280000 ---> 0:03:41.480000
      now increasingly believe that her images also contain subtle social commentary.
   Segment 46
      0:03:41.480000 ---> 0:03:47.520000
      The bucking horses may constitute symbols of freedom, specifically in this case in terms
   Segment 47
      0:03:47.520000 ---> 0:03:49.640000
      of gender freedom.
   Segment 48
      0:03:49.640000 ---> 0:03:55.640000
      While it may feel like a stretch or it may not resonate that way to today's viewers,
   Segment 49
      0:03:55.640000 ---> 0:04:01.640000
      many among the early feminist movement in France actually explicitly compared the plight
   Segment 50
      0:04:01.640000 ---> 0:04:06.440000
      of women to the subjugation and abuse of animals.
   Segment 51
      0:04:06.440000 ---> 0:04:11.960000
      Others in support of women's rights and animal rights movements, frequently made this
   Segment 52
      0:04:11.960000 ---> 0:04:15.360000
      comparison in their published literature.
   Segment 53
      0:04:15.360000 ---> 0:04:22.160000
      It therefore seems worth noting that the building looming in the background shadows silhouetted
   Segment 54
      0:04:22.160000 ---> 0:04:28.520000
      in the distant city haze is none other than the Sépultrére, the Parisian asylum inside
   Segment 55
      0:04:28.520000 ---> 0:04:32.800000
      which women were frequently imprisoned for hysteria.
   Segment 56
      0:04:32.800000 ---> 0:04:36.520000
      So a quick rundown on hysteria if you're not familiar.
   Segment 57
      0:04:36.520000 ---> 0:04:42.120000
      Though a now debunked field of psychology, doctors of the 19th century described hysteria
   Segment 58
      0:04:42.120000 ---> 0:04:44.840000
      as a disease of the nerves in women.
   Segment 59
      0:04:44.840000 ---> 0:04:51.480000
      Although that sounds medically, in practice, hysteria was used as a catch-all diagnosis
   Segment 60
      0:04:51.480000 ---> 0:04:54.080000
      for all mental illness.
   Segment 61
      0:04:54.080000 ---> 0:04:59.360000
      But also for women who just didn't conform to cultural norms, who didn't fit into the
   Segment 62
      0:04:59.360000 ---> 0:05:02.720000
      boxes that society established for them.
   Segment 63
      0:05:02.720000 ---> 0:05:08.840000
      Indeed, many first-way feminists wound up institutionalized as so-called hysterics
   Segment 64
      0:05:08.840000 ---> 0:05:11.520000
      for their social rebellions.
   Segment 65
      0:05:11.520000 ---> 0:05:15.880000
      So if that isn't enough to convince y'all, deepening the sense that Bonner may have
   Segment 66
      0:05:15.880000 ---> 0:05:20.640000
      embedded commentary within horse fare, our historians have noticed that she seems to
   Segment 67
      0:05:20.640000 ---> 0:05:24.440000
      have included a self-portrait, an image of herself.
   Segment 68
      0:05:24.440000 ---> 0:05:30.720000
      Throughout the scene, most figures have obvious facial hair, but near the center of the composition,
   Segment 69
      0:05:30.720000 ---> 0:05:36.920000
      one person looks out at us, barefaced and seeming to possess quiet purpose.
   Segment 70
      0:05:36.920000 ---> 0:05:42.600000
      Before the widespread use of the camera, self-portraits in paintings typically appear in three-quarter
   Segment 71
      0:05:42.600000 ---> 0:05:43.600000
      view.
   Segment 72
      0:05:43.600000 ---> 0:05:48.440000
      This makes sense, because artists had to look both in the mirror and the canvas in quick
   Segment 73
      0:05:48.440000 ---> 0:05:49.600000
      succession.
   Segment 74
      0:05:49.600000 ---> 0:05:55.080000
      Here we see an example of that, a little selfie of Raphael in the School of Athens.
   Segment 75
      0:05:55.080000 ---> 0:05:59.280000
      And here we see, surely probably right, Bonner.
   Segment 76
      0:05:59.280000 ---> 0:06:02.840000
      Looking out at us, her eyes shaded by her cap.
   Segment 77
      0:06:02.840000 ---> 0:06:10.440000
      A similar figure, dressed almost identically, appears in Gathering for the Hunt of 1856.
   Segment 78
      0:06:10.440000 ---> 0:06:15.440000
      If this is Bonner, and I think it is, she depicts herself straddling the horse in a
   Segment 79
      0:06:15.440000 ---> 0:06:20.120000
      mode that would be considered masculine at the time, rather than the more acceptable
   Segment 80
      0:06:20.120000 ---> 0:06:23
      style of writing side saddle.
   Segment 81
      0:06:23 ---> 0:06:27.440000
      Like the stockyard, the horse fare was a decidedly masculine space.
   Segment 82
      0:06:27.920000 ---> 0:06:31.160000
      But here, Bonner pushes against that.
   Segment 83
      0:06:31.160000 ---> 0:06:34.080000
      She queers the space, if you will.
   Segment 84
      0:06:34.080000 ---> 0:06:39.320000
      With a quick caveat here that we don't know precisely how Bonner would have self-identified
   Segment 85
      0:06:39.320000 ---> 0:06:46.480000
      in terms of sexuality or gender identity if alive today, we can say, indeed, that she
   Segment 86
      0:06:46.480000 ---> 0:06:52.440000
      lived her 40 years in a home with Natalie Maicas, a woman whom she referred to as her
   Segment 87
      0:06:52.440000 ---> 0:06:53.640000
      wife.
   Segment 88
      0:06:53.720000 ---> 0:06:59.360000
      Following her wife's death, she fell in love with an American woman, a fellow painter.
   Segment 89
      0:06:59.360000 ---> 0:07:06.200000
      To this day, Bonner is buried between them at Parleche's Cemetery in the Heart of Paris.
   Segment 90
      0:07:06.200000 ---> 0:07:11.560000
      Although never speaking about it directly, she also never actively hid her sexuality
   Segment 91
      0:07:11.560000 ---> 0:07:13.440000
      per se.
   Segment 92
      0:07:13.440000 ---> 0:07:19.360000
      In the mid-19th century, the concept of lesbianism was not fully formed.
   Segment 93
      0:07:19.360000 ---> 0:07:26.440000
      Women women like Bonner or the writer George Sand were seen as peculiar and unnatural.
   Segment 94
      0:07:26.440000 ---> 0:07:33.520000
      However, women as a group were seen as non-sexual beings who possessed little desire of their
   Segment 95
      0:07:33.520000 ---> 0:07:34.520000
      own.
   Segment 96
      0:07:34.520000 ---> 0:07:41.520000
      Moreover, close and even romantic friendships between women were totally the norm.
   Segment 97
      0:07:41.520000 ---> 0:07:46.520000
      It wasn't all that uncommon for widows or so-called spinsters to live with a close
   Segment 98
      0:07:46.520000 ---> 0:07:48.360000
      female friend.
   Segment 99
      0:07:48.360000 ---> 0:07:53.920000
      Therefore, lesbianism itself was hardly on society's radar.
   Segment 100
      0:07:53.920000 ---> 0:08:00.080000
      And while this invisibility is sort of a problem, in a funny way, it also kind of enabled lesbianism
   Segment 101
      0:08:00.080000 ---> 0:08:07.120000
      to exist largely unnoticed, and therefore without quite as much persecution.
   Segment 102
      0:08:07.120000 ---> 0:08:12.600000
      So Rose de Bonner was out here doing her thing, and a time before lesbianism was a fully-formed
   Segment 103
      0:08:12.600000 ---> 0:08:15.160000
      subculture or identity.
   Segment 104
      0:08:15.160000 ---> 0:08:20.040000
      Through her life and her paintings, like horse fare, she carved a space for herself
   Segment 105
      0:08:20.040000 ---> 0:08:23
      to exist as authentically as she could.
   Segment 106
      0:08:23 ---> 0:08:29.200000
      Still, admittedly, the extent to which viewers recognized Bonner's apparent feminist commentary
   Segment 107
      0:08:29.200000 ---> 0:08:32.560000
      in this work is unclear.
   Segment 108
      0:08:32.560000 ---> 0:08:39.440000
      Perhaps it flew over the head of most viewers, but maybe just maybe, at the same time, spoke
   Segment 109
      0:08:39.440000 ---> 0:08:44.960000
      to an alternate audience that was more primed to understand its meanings.
   Segment 110
      0:08:44.960000 ---> 0:08:51.520000
      In conclusion, Rose de Bonner was a 19th-century painter who specialized in animal painting.
   Segment 111
      0:08:51.520000 ---> 0:08:57.560000
      As an artist, she bucked against the system that institutionally favored white male artists.
   Segment 112
      0:08:57.560000 ---> 0:09:03.400000
      Her largest work, the horse fare seems to speak of freedom, and the strength to resist,
   Segment 113
      0:09:03.400000 ---> 0:09:08.160000
      a message that may have been a reference to the oppression of women.
   Segment 114
      0:09:08.160000 ---> 0:09:13.720000
      The old notion of Bonner as someone with an interesting life but boring paintings is
   Segment 115
      0:09:13.720000 ---> 0:09:19.920000
      shifting in recognition that her art often contains layered social commentary that subverted
   Segment 116
      0:09:19.920000 ---> 0:09:22.120000
      gender norms of the day.
   Segment 117
      0:09:22.120000 ---> 0:09:26.160000
      So not only was her life radical, but so too was her art.

Transcription for audio6.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:06.500000
      In this video, we're going to be talking about Mary Cassatt, particularly focusing on her painting in the Loge.
   Segment 2
      0:00:06.500000 ---> 0:00:17.700000
      Before we dive into the specifics of the painting itself, it would be a good idea to think a bit about the artistic movement of which she was a part.
   Segment 3
      0:00:17.700000 ---> 0:00:26.300000
      Mary Cassatt was an American artist, but after receiving training in the United States, she decided to move to Paris,
   Segment 4
      0:00:26.300000 ---> 0:00:32.200000
      where she felt that she would have an easier time being taken seriously as an artist.
   Segment 5
      0:00:32.200000 ---> 0:00:43.300000
      In the 19th century, it wasn't unusual for an artist who was interested in experimenting with more cutting-edge styles, like impressionism,
   Segment 6
      0:00:43.300000 ---> 0:00:50.700000
      to decide to leave the United States in search of a community wherein those styles were more accepted.
   Segment 7
      0:00:50.800000 ---> 0:01:01.200000
      Moreover, as a woman artist, she felt that her career was limited in the United States and believed that Paris would afford larger opportunities.
   Segment 8
      0:01:01.200000 ---> 0:01:08.800000
      Once in Paris, she befriended the Impressionists, particularly becoming close to the artist Edgar DeGau.
   Segment 9
      0:01:08.800000 ---> 0:01:16.200000
      Impressionism is characterized formally by a looser, more gestural style of painting.
   Segment 10
      0:01:16.300000 ---> 0:01:28.900000
      Looking, for example, at Monet's painting on the right, the figures that swarm the boulevard below are depicted with quick impromptu applications of paint,
   Segment 11
      0:01:28.900000 ---> 0:01:34.700000
      wherein the artist does not seek to disguise the fact that we're looking at paint on a surface.
   Segment 12
      0:01:34.700000 ---> 0:01:37.400000
      Rather, that's kind of the point.
   Segment 13
      0:01:37.400000 ---> 0:01:50.300000
      In an impressionist painting, the sketch, the loose, more improvisational image that is typically taken back to a studio in order to be transformed into something more, quote unquote, finished,
   Segment 14
      0:01:50.300000 ---> 0:01:52.300000
      in fact, here becomes the work.
   Segment 15
      0:01:52.300000 ---> 0:02:00.200000
      The sketch and the finished product are one and the same, whereas more traditional history painters, for example,
   Segment 16
      0:02:00.300000 ---> 0:02:10.300000
      oftentimes spent many months to years creating pristine surfaces that depicted elaborate mythological scenes, well-known narratives.
   Segment 17
      0:02:10.300000 ---> 0:02:20.500000
      The Impressionists were instead interested in creating quick sketches that could embody the here now, the immediate, the fleeting.
   Segment 18
      0:02:20.500000 ---> 0:02:24.300000
      The Impressionists looked to the modern world unfolding around them.
   Segment 19
      0:02:24.400000 ---> 0:02:34.500000
      Many artists, for example, depicted the wide boulevards of newly renovated Paris, capturing the energetic flow of the urban city.
   Segment 20
      0:02:34.500000 ---> 0:02:42.600000
      Other artists focused on the nightlife, scenes of leisure and escapism, and at times debauchery.
   Segment 21
      0:02:42.600000 ---> 0:02:51.600000
      Manet's, the bar at the Foli Bergere, has been interpreted as a space wherein the sinful becomes permissible,
   Segment 22
      0:02:51.700000 ---> 0:03:01.100000
      wherein the viewer is invited to question whether the bar made is simply a bar made, or may perhaps double as a prostitute, in fact.
   Segment 23
      0:03:01.100000 ---> 0:03:08.900000
      Scenes of prostitution, scenes of brothels, were prevalently found in Impressionist imagery.
   Segment 24
      0:03:08.900000 ---> 0:03:16.100000
      The work of the Impressionists was also typically smaller in scale than their more neoclassical counterparts,
   Segment 25
      0:03:16.200000 ---> 0:03:25.500000
      rather than being displayed and sold at the yearly French Salon, which was the government-sanctioned exhibition of important work.
   Segment 26
      0:03:25.500000 ---> 0:03:33.500000
      The Impressionists showed their work at smaller gallery shows and appealed to a different kind of clientele.
   Segment 27
      0:03:33.500000 ---> 0:03:46
      This shift in where art was seen and sold, and in fact, who was doing the purchasing, dramatically impacted the kind of work that was possible during this era.
   Segment 28
      0:03:46 ---> 0:03:52.300000
      Many women artists gravitated to Impressionism, and part for this reason.
   Segment 29
      0:03:52.300000 ---> 0:04:02.300000
      Women artists were less likely to receive the kinds of large neoclassical commissions that many of their male colleagues were receiving during these years.
   Segment 30
      0:04:02.300000 ---> 0:04:14.100000
      Therefore, it makes sense that women artists of the era might be drawn to a style that encourages smaller easel paintings that show mundane rather than grandiose scenes.
   Segment 31
      0:04:14.200000 ---> 0:04:21.600000
      Another major subject matter found within Impressionism are quiet scenes of interior domestic life.
   Segment 32
      0:04:21.600000 ---> 0:04:26.100000
      This comprises much of the imagery in Maricosot's body of work.
   Segment 33
      0:04:26.100000 ---> 0:04:28.200000
      Here we can see two examples.
   Segment 34
      0:04:28.200000 ---> 0:04:36.200000
      Oftentimes these images involve scenes of mothers and children, poised in sweet interactions with one another,
   Segment 35
      0:04:36.300000 ---> 0:04:45.100000
      and at times like in Girl in a Blue Armshare, we see scenes of children that feel authentic to their emotional experience.
   Segment 36
      0:04:45.100000 ---> 0:04:50.900000
      Although certainly the Impressionists who were men didn't fact paint domestic scenes,
   Segment 37
      0:04:50.900000 ---> 0:05:00.700000
      scholars have argued that Maricosot's versions of this subject differ in meaningful ways from some of her male peers.
   Segment 38
      0:05:00.700000 ---> 0:05:10.500000
      First, art historians such as Griselda Pollock have convincingly argued that Maricosot, by painting domestic scenes,
   Segment 39
      0:05:10.500000 ---> 0:05:16.300000
      is painting one of the only subject matters, in fact, available to her as a woman artist.
   Segment 40
      0:05:16.300000 ---> 0:05:23.800000
      Whereas as we saw in the previous slide, Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, etc.,
   Segment 41
      0:05:23.800000 ---> 0:05:31.300000
      the male artists who were part of the Impressionist movement were busy painting the street life, nightlife,
   Segment 42
      0:05:31.300000 ---> 0:05:40.900000
      at times scenes of sin and debauchery, these kinds of subject matters would have been seen as inappropriate if depicted by a woman artist.
   Segment 43
      0:05:40.900000 ---> 0:05:49.300000
      Then second of all, art historians have argued the way she chooses to depict these scenes seems to stand out among her peers.
   Segment 44
      0:05:49.300000 ---> 0:05:56.600000
      For example, in Girl in a Blue Armshare, here we see a child who is not posing for us.
   Segment 45
      0:05:56.600000 ---> 0:06:01.500000
      She is not a pretty doll posing for us in a pleasing way.
   Segment 46
      0:06:01.500000 ---> 0:06:08.200000
      Rather, this seems to speak of a sort of authentic experience of childhood.
   Segment 47
      0:06:08.200000 ---> 0:06:17.200000
      She looks to be seated in a room that was not made for her, an adult space that overwhelms her in terms of the size of the furniture.
   Segment 48
      0:06:17.200000 ---> 0:06:20.800000
      She slouches rather than performing for our gaze.
   Segment 49
      0:06:20.800000 ---> 0:06:25.500000
      She looks downward with an expression that suggests boredom.
   Segment 50
      0:06:25.500000 ---> 0:06:32
      Were her parents to walk in the room, they might tell her to straighten up, to sit in a more quote unquote, ladylike way.
   Segment 51
      0:06:32 ---> 0:06:42.200000
      In fact, rather than seeing this scene from a more adult perspective, we feel as though we are as viewers, in fact, down on her level.
   Segment 52
      0:06:42.300000 ---> 0:06:56.700000
      Looking at where the horizon cuts across the scene, it's very high up in the composition, making us feel tied to the ground, as if we are the same height as the child represented.
   Segment 53
      0:06:56.700000 ---> 0:07:11.900000
      Although Mary Cassatt, as a middle-class woman of social prominence, would not have been permitted socially to depict the kinds of scenes that we saw, for example, in Menet's Bar at the Fully Bear Share,
   Segment 54
      0:07:11.900000 ---> 0:07:26.200000
      the opera house afforded one opportunity wherein women artists could participate in the modern practice of people watching that became the intense focus of the Impressionist movement.
   Segment 55
      0:07:26.200000 ---> 0:07:41
      In addition to certainly being discouraged from depicting scenes of debaucherous nightlife, women in general in late 19th century Paris were not permitted to walk the streets alone.
   Segment 56
      0:07:41.100000 ---> 0:07:57.400000
      So, in fact, even the scenes of modern cityscapes, as we saw painted by Monet, are fairly uncommon to see amongst women Impressionists, who would have always walked the city streets in the company of a companion.
   Segment 57
      0:07:57.500000 ---> 0:08:06.800000
      The opera house, though, was a space where women of the middle and upper classes could go and be part of the modern spectacle.
   Segment 58
      0:08:06.800000 ---> 0:08:16.400000
      In fact, looking at the design of the Paris opera house, the main staircase betrays this primary function of people watching.
   Segment 59
      0:08:16.500000 ---> 0:08:22.400000
      If you look at the top of the staircase, you might start to notice balcony outcroppings.
   Segment 60
      0:08:22.900000 ---> 0:08:30.900000
      These balconies provided a prime location to view those who walk up the stairs below.
   Segment 61
      0:08:31.200000 ---> 0:08:44.500000
      Moreover, they also position individuals to themselves function as a sort of visual spectacle, as those who are walking up the stairs can also easily inspect those on the balcony.
   Segment 62
      0:08:44.500000 ---> 0:08:53
      In Mary Cassatt's Woman in a Loge, here we can see a woman who is seated in one of the upper seating levels of the theater.
   Segment 63
      0:08:53 ---> 0:08:57.800000
      The theater would have large open seating areas in front of the stage.
   Segment 64
      0:08:57.800000 ---> 0:09:01.300000
      These are, for lack of a better word, the cheap seats.
   Segment 65
      0:09:01.300000 ---> 0:09:03
      And then there was the Loge.
   Segment 66
      0:09:03 ---> 0:09:10
      The Loge were a series of box seats that circled around the exterior of the theater.
   Segment 67
      0:09:10.600000 ---> 0:09:20.500000
      Oftentimes, these Loge seats did not provide, in fact, the best view of the opera or play taking place on the stage below.
   Segment 68
      0:09:20.500000 ---> 0:09:34
      Rather, similar to the balconies we see in the Grand Stairwell, these seats were prime locations to both see others who are in attendance and also to be seen yourself.
   Segment 69
      0:09:34 ---> 0:09:39.800000
      This is something that Cassatt plays with in her depictions of Loge seats.
   Segment 70
      0:09:40.600000 ---> 0:09:54
      Here, in Woman in a Loge, we can see a young woman in a pink dress who is gazing out at the audience on the other side of her, which is reflected back to us in the mirror placed behind her.
   Segment 71
      0:09:54 ---> 0:09:59.400000
      She appears to be actively and eagerly engaged in this people watching activity.
   Segment 72
      0:09:59.400000 ---> 0:10:04.800000
      Here are two more impressionist interpretations of Loge seats.
   Segment 73
      0:10:04.800000 ---> 0:10:08.300000
      On the left, La Loge, by Renoir.
   Segment 74
      0:10:08.300000 ---> 0:10:11
      Here we see a young couple, it seems.
   Segment 75
      0:10:11 ---> 0:10:21.300000
      The man in the back, actively engaged, looking at, looking at viewers in the Loge seats in the row above them, whereas the woman sits passively.
   Segment 76
      0:10:21.300000 ---> 0:10:24.100000
      Her gaze, indirect.
   Segment 77
      0:10:24.100000 ---> 0:10:26.700000
      We try but fail to catch her eye line.
   Segment 78
      0:10:26.700000 ---> 0:10:33.700000
      Rather than an act of participant in this people watching activity, she remains a beautiful object for our inspection.
   Segment 79
      0:10:33.700000 ---> 0:10:44.700000
      Her outfit is elaborate and draws our eye in to, for example, her decolatage, which is highlighted for us by a pink flower.
   Segment 80
      0:10:44.700000 ---> 0:10:51.300000
      Her strings of pearls further lead our eye downward to inspect the low cut of her dress.
   Segment 81
      0:10:51.300000 ---> 0:10:58.500000
      She holds in one of her hands a set of binoculars, but does not employ them and her gaze appears empty.
   Segment 82
      0:10:58.500000 ---> 0:11:04
      Renoir, in fact, famously said that he preferred his women models to not think.
   Segment 83
      0:11:04 ---> 0:11:11.600000
      In contrast, Mary Cassatt's subject feels actively engaged in this modern pursuit of people watching.
   Segment 84
      0:11:11.600000 ---> 0:11:14.600000
      She does not appear to be watching the play.
   Segment 85
      0:11:14.600000 ---> 0:11:22.400000
      In fact, indeed, if she were watching the play, we would expect to see her set of binoculars peering downward.
   Segment 86
      0:11:22.400000 ---> 0:11:37
      But rather, they peer straightforward, suggesting that she too is a participant in the modern scene, not just an object to be looked at, but an agent, someone with agency who is also able to look in return.
   Segment 87
      0:11:37 ---> 0:11:46
      A man in a Loge, a few boxes down, bins over the railing almost comically to inspect the subject in the foreground.
   Segment 88
      0:11:46 ---> 0:11:51.500000
      She's dressed modestly in a way that does not seem to be poised to attract attention.
   Segment 89
      0:11:51.500000 ---> 0:12:00.800000
      Black had been made popular earlier in the century when Queen Victoria in England had adopted it as her exclusive color palette.
   Segment 90
      0:12:00.800000 ---> 0:12:10.500000
      In Paris, it was no longer necessarily tied to mourning, but was in fact oftentimes worn by women as a way to blend in on the streets.
   Segment 91
      0:12:10.500000 ---> 0:12:13.600000
      Nonetheless, she's dressed elegantly.
   Segment 92
      0:12:13.600000 ---> 0:12:22.200000
      Black was fashionable, and she, similar to what we see in Renoir's painting, carries a fan and wears off white gloves.
   Segment 93
      0:12:22.200000 ---> 0:12:34.300000
      Reading primary sources from the era, it is clear that women in public in France were oftentimes treated as objects for visual consumption of others.
   Segment 94
      0:12:34.300000 ---> 0:12:42.700000
      Looking at this first quote, for example, quote, how many irritations for the single woman she can hardly ever go out in the evening.
   Segment 95
      0:12:42.700000 ---> 0:12:44.900000
      She would be taken for a prostitute.
   Segment 96
      0:12:44.900000 ---> 0:12:48.100000
      There are a thousand places where only men are to be seen.
   Segment 97
      0:12:48.100000 ---> 0:12:52.400000
      If she needs to go there in business, the men are amazed and laugh like fools.
   Segment 98
      0:12:52.400000 ---> 0:12:55.200000
      She will not dare to enter into a restaurant.
   Segment 99
      0:12:55.200000 ---> 0:12:56.900000
      She would constitute an event.
   Segment 100
      0:12:56.900000 ---> 0:12:58.500000
      She would be a spectacle.
   Segment 101
      0:12:58.500000 ---> 0:13:01.800000
      All eyes would be constantly fixed on her.
   Segment 102
      0:13:01.800000 ---> 0:13:05.900000
      She would overhear uncomplimentary and bold conjectures.
   Segment 103
      0:13:05.900000 ---> 0:13:12.600000
      I think it's safe to say that in Renoir's depiction of this subject matter, here we in fact do see women in the world.
   Segment 104
      0:13:12.600000 ---> 0:13:16.200000
      Women as spectacle, all eyes are fixed on her.
   Segment 105
      0:13:16.200000 ---> 0:13:20.600000
      The second quote from 1890 is from a woman artist of the day.
   Segment 106
      0:13:20.600000 ---> 0:13:25.600000
      Quote, what I long for is the freedom of going about alone, of coming and going.
   Segment 107
      0:13:25.600000 ---> 0:13:27.100000
      That's what I long for.
   Segment 108
      0:13:27.100000 ---> 0:13:31
      And that's the freedom without which I cannot become a real artist.
   Segment 109
      0:13:31 ---> 0:13:41.500000
      Do imagine that I get much good from what I see chaperone as I am and when in order to go to the Louvre, I must wait for my carriage, my lady companion, my family.
   Segment 110
      0:13:41.500000 ---> 0:13:49.200000
      It is this cultural attitude that Mary Cassatt in the Louvre seems to be parodying, subverting.
   Segment 111
      0:13:49.200000 ---> 0:14:03.900000
      Whereas Renoir's version seems to reproduce this power exchange uncritically, Cassatt seems to offer a bit of criticism and in fact, implicates us in our own participation in this dynamic.
   Segment 112
      0:14:03.900000 ---> 0:14:17.500000
      The comic overreach of the man in the background, who seeks a better view of our main character, mirrors our own desire to look upon the scene and makes us question our own position in the narrative.
   Segment 113
      0:14:17.500000 ---> 0:14:25
      Here, a cartoon from 1848 makes a similar point from a series titled Little Miseries of Human Life.
   Segment 114
      0:14:25 ---> 0:14:32.700000
      Here we see a woman presumably going to the theater who is subject to prying eyes of all those who are around her.
   Segment 115
      0:14:32.700000 ---> 0:14:35.900000
      Whereas this may not immediately speak of violence.
   Segment 116
      0:14:35.900000 ---> 0:14:47.900000
      This is what we might call in modern terms, perhaps a microaggression, suggesting that the cumulative effect of these gazes makes her feel vulnerable on guard.
   Segment 117
      0:14:47.900000 ---> 0:14:58
      There's a helpful quote by a cultural thinker named John Berger from his book Ways of Seeing that I sometimes introduce when thinking about this image.
   Segment 118
      0:14:58 ---> 0:15:02.800000
      The quote is, men watch and women watch themselves being watched.
   Segment 119
      0:15:02.800000 ---> 0:15:16.200000
      And while I think to some extent in modern culture, particularly under modern states of surveillance, we're all to some degree watched in society and hyper aware of the fact that we are being watched.
   Segment 120
      0:15:16.600000 ---> 0:15:35.600000
      I do think that there is a helpful sort of negative truth in John Berger's assertion that here in the Little Miseries scene, the main character is being intensely watched and cannot escape the awareness of those prying eyes as she merely tries to enter into the theater.
   Segment 121
      0:15:35.800000 ---> 0:15:43.400000
      In conclusion, Mary Cassatt was an American artist who joined up in Paris with the impressionists.
   Segment 122
      0:15:43.800000 ---> 0:16:05.400000
      Impressionism in general was a movement that was open to and often chosen by women artists of the day in that it prioritized smaller canvas works that could be sold to a gallery audience rather than larger commissions that most women artists were not receiving during these times.
   Segment 123
      0:16:05.600000 ---> 0:16:22.400000
      Impressionist artists depicted the world in a fleeting and gestural way and oftentimes focused on mundane scenes of day to day modern existence, only some of which were available as subject matter to women artists.
   Segment 124
      0:16:22.500000 ---> 0:16:35.100000
      Many women artists of the impressionist movement like Mary Cassatt or also famously, but more so primarily depicted domestic scenes, in part because that was the subject matter available to them.
   Segment 125
      0:16:35.300000 ---> 0:16:41
      They also arguably depicted those scenes differently than some of their colleagues did.
   Segment 126
      0:16:41.100000 ---> 0:17:01.200000
      In the case of the low scenes by Cassatt, here she's depicting one of the only spaces in Paris available to middle and upper class white women where they were able to participate in the modern activity of people watching that became so central to the impressionist body of work.
   Segment 127
      0:17:01.300000 ---> 0:17:10.500000
      Here, Mary Cassatt seems to satirize critique the way that women are treated as spectacles as they attempt to go about their daily lives.

Transcription for audio7.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:04.640000
      In this lecture, we're going to talk about a self-portrait by the artist Ellen Day Hale,
   Segment 2
      0:00:04.640000 ---> 0:00:08.080000
      which honestly may be one of my favorite paintings of all time.
   Segment 3
      0:00:09.120000 ---> 0:00:15.040000
      Ellen Day Hale was a late 19th century painter from Boston, who spent many years studying her
   Segment 4
      0:00:15.040000 ---> 0:00:20.720000
      craft in Paris at the Academy Juleon, where she would have been exposed to the style and subject
   Segment 5
      0:00:20.720000 ---> 0:00:27.280000
      matters of Impressionism. Before we dive more into her life, let's take a long hard look at this
   Segment 6
      0:00:27.280000 ---> 0:00:33.760000
      really stunning painting. Here Hale depicts herself leaning back in her chair, holding a large,
   Segment 7
      0:00:33.760000 ---> 0:00:40.240000
      dark brown ostrich-feathered fan, and she looks at us with an error of unshakable confidence.
   Segment 8
      0:00:40.240000 ---> 0:00:46.640000
      Her head tilted slightly upward with the bottom of her chin visible to us. This positioning
   Segment 9
      0:00:46.640000 ---> 0:00:53.520000
      creates the impression of monumentality, as if Hale is here quite literally looking down her nose at
   Segment 10
      0:00:53.600000 ---> 0:01:00.960000
      us. She feels almost impossibly comfortable with herself. Her body language is lax and spread out.
   Segment 11
      0:01:01.840000 ---> 0:01:07.360000
      In photographs, I'll tell you, and you'll see in a minute, this person has a really small frame,
   Segment 12
      0:01:07.360000 ---> 0:01:15.120000
      but here, Hale is really emphasizing mass. She feels large and imposing. Her fan really adds to
   Segment 13
      0:01:15.120000 ---> 0:01:21.040000
      this illusion, I think. Then, rather than sitting with her hands tightly clasped on her lap, as you
   Segment 14
      0:01:21.040000 ---> 0:01:27.040000
      might expect of a well-to-do woman of this era, Hale is taking up space in a way that is more
   Segment 15
      0:01:27.040000 ---> 0:01:33.520000
      often associated with men. And I almost hesitate to mention man spreading here, but it's worth
   Segment 16
      0:01:33.520000 ---> 0:01:39.440000
      pointing out, right, that here, she is refusing to be small, refusing to be delicate, and demanding
   Segment 17
      0:01:39.440000 ---> 0:01:46.320000
      the space to exist. Hale is also here wearing clothing that commands seriousness. Rather than
   Segment 18
      0:01:46.400000 ---> 0:01:52.880000
      wearing a more delicate, revealing, or feminine garment, here, she dons a dark brown dress that,
   Segment 19
      0:01:52.880000 ---> 0:01:58.880000
      because of its darkness, right, its sort of murkiness, it's almost indistinguishable from a suit.
   Segment 20
      0:01:59.600000 ---> 0:02:05.360000
      Her face feels real and individualized. This isn't some over-idealized,
   Segment 21
      0:02:05.360000 ---> 0:02:11.120000
      prettified object for our pleasure. Rather, she feels like a thinking, breathing person,
   Segment 22
      0:02:11.120000 ---> 0:02:16.800000
      right, a unique individual, and a person not to be messed with. Her strong features might have
   Segment 23
      0:02:16.800000 ---> 0:02:22.720000
      been read, again, as masculine in a society that was quite used to seeing depictions of women who
   Segment 24
      0:02:22.720000 ---> 0:02:30.640000
      look like soft, boneless baby dolls, looking at you, vernoir. Instead, she stares at us with an
   Segment 25
      0:02:30.640000 ---> 0:02:37.360000
      unblinking glare, refusing to submit to our gaze. Again, this is an individual who will not be small
   Segment 26
      0:02:37.360000 ---> 0:02:44.480000
      for our comfort. Her long hair is tucked behind her shoulders, and her blunt bangs also create
   Segment 27
      0:02:44.480000 ---> 0:02:49.920000
      the impression that she has a cropped, more masculine hairstyle. The blue floral background
   Segment 28
      0:02:49.920000 ---> 0:02:56.720000
      further isolates her figure in space and betrays a familiarity with Impressionist brushwork.
   Segment 29
      0:02:56.720000 ---> 0:03:02.400000
      Notably, although an American artist, Hale painted this work while she was a student in Paris,
   Segment 30
      0:03:02.480000 ---> 0:03:08.240000
      and intended it for the yearly salon exhibition there. However, she received some pushback from
   Segment 31
      0:03:08.240000 ---> 0:03:14.400000
      her more conservative instructor. Her hand in the painting was a particular point of contention.
   Segment 32
      0:03:15.360000 ---> 0:03:21.200000
      According to a written account of the exchange by Hale, her French painting instructor complained
   Segment 33
      0:03:21.200000 ---> 0:03:27.040000
      that her hand was too hard and too masculine, and that she should soften it and lighten the skin.
   Segment 34
      0:03:27.920000 ---> 0:03:33.760000
      He suggested that she should just hold her hand over her head and tell all of the blood just
   Segment 35
      0:03:33.760000 ---> 0:03:39.040000
      drains out of it, and it becomes swollen and plumper and paler in appearance.
   Segment 36
      0:03:40.080000 ---> 0:03:45.520000
      Hale, I think as we can all tell, refused this advice and kept her hand as it is.
   Segment 37
      0:03:46.240000 ---> 0:03:51.040000
      Tantalizingly, in this written account, she also refers to this painting as, quote,
   Segment 38
      0:03:51.040000 ---> 0:03:57.760000
      original and queer. Okay, so in the right top corner of this slide, you can see a photograph of
   Segment 39
      0:03:57.760000 ---> 0:04:05.760000
      Hale. And as I was suggesting earlier, you can tell that she has really overemphasized her size,
   Segment 40
      0:04:05.760000 ---> 0:04:10.560000
      and we can also note that her painting, right, where she's presenting herself, rather than a
   Segment 41
      0:04:10.560000 ---> 0:04:16.400000
      photographer presenting her, how they would like to see her, she has shown in a much bolder position
   Segment 42
      0:04:16.400000 ---> 0:04:22.320000
      in the painting. I want to be clear that none of this is unintentional, none of this is a mistake,
   Segment 43
      0:04:22.320000 ---> 0:04:28.080000
      she is really making a choice here. Hale is an individual who came from a long line of radical
   Segment 44
      0:04:28.080000 ---> 0:04:35.840000
      women. Her great aunt was the influential, albeit problematic, abolitionist writer Harriet Beecher
   Segment 45
      0:04:35.840000 ---> 0:04:42.480000
      Stowe, and her cousin was a writer and social reformer, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, who famously
   Segment 46
      0:04:42.480000 ---> 0:04:47.520000
      authored the Yellow Wallpaper. If you are not familiar with the Yellow Wallpaper, it was an
   Segment 47
      0:04:47.520000 ---> 0:04:54.080000
      early feminist text that describes a woman who is so unhappy and her forced domestic situation,
   Segment 48
      0:04:54.080000 ---> 0:04:59.920000
      that she begins to hallucinate and obsess over the Yellow Wallpaper in her room. Hale was, I think
   Segment 49
      0:04:59.920000 ---> 0:05:06.480000
      it's safe to say, a good representation of the late 19th century phenomenon of the New Woman,
   Segment 50
      0:05:06.480000 ---> 0:05:12.400000
      or the Fim Nouvelle in French. The New Woman described a woman who pushed against the normative
   Segment 51
      0:05:12.400000 ---> 0:05:18.720000
      limits of femininity of the era. The New Woman often worked and supported herself, and sometimes
   Segment 52
      0:05:18.720000 ---> 0:05:24.160000
      chose to remain unmarried for various reasons, right, one of which being just independence.
   Segment 53
      0:05:24.800000 ---> 0:05:30.240000
      It's worth noting that while not synonymous, there is a strong correlation between the New
   Segment 54
      0:05:30.240000 ---> 0:05:36.240000
      Woman and burgeoning lesbian culture of this time. To that point, though we don't know what
   Segment 55
      0:05:36.240000 ---> 0:05:41.440000
      labels she would have chosen, as best we know, Hale was herself a lesbian, though she may not
   Segment 56
      0:05:41.520000 ---> 0:05:46.720000
      have used that language. Here on the right we see another New Woman, Frances Benjamin Johnston,
   Segment 57
      0:05:46.720000 ---> 0:05:52
      also a lesbian. Looking at these two private self-portraits by Johnston, particularly in
   Segment 58
      0:05:52 ---> 0:05:58.320000
      the lower right, we can see her donning masculine attire and a false mustache while posing with a
   Segment 59
      0:05:58.320000 ---> 0:06:05.120000
      bike, a simple and a practical object of the New Woman's increased mobility. Interestingly,
   Segment 60
      0:06:05.120000 ---> 0:06:11.120000
      bangs were also associated with the New Woman, and were seen as a transgressive hairstyle for the era.
   Segment 61
      0:06:11.920000 ---> 0:06:17.280000
      I know this is going to sound maybe a little absurd to y'all, but an editorial titled The
   Segment 62
      0:06:17.280000 ---> 0:06:24.240000
      Girl Who Wears Bangs for the Washington Post from 1883 describes the banged girl thusly.
   Segment 63
      0:06:24.240000 ---> 0:06:30.720000
      Quote, the banged girl may try to be good and true, but it's awfully hard work. When she looks at
   Segment 64
      0:06:30.720000 ---> 0:06:35.920000
      herself in the glass and sees a quarter of an inch of forehead, she says to herself,
   Segment 65
      0:06:35.920000 ---> 0:06:42.880000
      I am dangerous. They want to look out for me. Honestly, kind of hilarious. Though Hale never
   Segment 66
      0:06:42.880000 ---> 0:06:47.760000
      married, technically speaking, she was in a long-term relationship with her live-in partner,
   Segment 67
      0:06:47.760000 ---> 0:06:54.560000
      Gabrielle de Vaux Klimmets, also a painter. The two set up an adorable cottage home outside of
   Segment 68
      0:06:54.560000 ---> 0:07:00.160000
      Gloucester, Massachusetts, that they dubbed The Thickets, and the pair hosted summer painting
   Segment 69
      0:07:00.160000 ---> 0:07:05.600000
      schools wherein they taught many in the subsequent generation of women artists. History will call
   Segment 70
      0:07:05.600000 ---> 0:07:11.760000
      them gal pals, am I right? At the time, people may have referred to the relationship as a romantic
   Segment 71
      0:07:11.760000 ---> 0:07:17.440000
      friendship or as a Boston marriage, an expression at the time for two women who shared their lives.
   Segment 72
      0:07:18.240000 ---> 0:07:24.560000
      By the way, while women faced prejudice and obstacles by dent of being women in a sexist society,
   Segment 73
      0:07:24.560000 ---> 0:07:30
      lesbians enjoyed a bit more freedom in establishing public relationships than did gay men.
   Segment 74
      0:07:30.720000 ---> 0:07:37.280000
      The reason for this is rooted in prejudice. Women were seen at this time as asexual beings,
   Segment 75
      0:07:37.840000 ---> 0:07:43.600000
      incapable of having their own desires or wanting to have sex outside of a man initiating it.
   Segment 76
      0:07:44.160000 ---> 0:07:49.680000
      So the idea that two women living together were in a sexual relationship with one another was
   Segment 77
      0:07:49.680000 ---> 0:07:56.160000
      in this moment seemingly unimaginable. Although today we know that this is false, right? It's
   Segment 78
      0:07:56.640000 ---> 0:08:01.600000
      pretty absurd. This stereotype nonetheless gave women who loved women a helpful cover.
   Segment 79
      0:08:02.480000 ---> 0:08:08.080000
      It was not deemed inappropriate or strange for women to develop intense and lifelong friendships
   Segment 80
      0:08:08.080000 ---> 0:08:14.720000
      with one another, and that often took on a romantic tone. Therefore lesbians were able to disguise
   Segment 81
      0:08:14.720000 ---> 0:08:20.960000
      their actual romantic and sexual relationships through this social norm. In conclusion, Ellen
   Segment 82
      0:08:21.040000 ---> 0:08:27.360000
      Dikel's self-portrait is indeed original and queer. She depicts herself in a confident and
   Segment 83
      0:08:27.360000 ---> 0:08:33.920000
      spread out stance that pushes against the expectations of femininity for this time. She looks down at
   Segment 84
      0:08:33.920000 ---> 0:08:39.920000
      us and returns our gaze with an intelligent and forceful expression. She came from a family of
   Segment 85
      0:08:39.920000 ---> 0:08:46.240000
      strong activist women and was herself what we might call a new woman. She also lived her life in an
   Segment 86
      0:08:46.240000 ---> 0:08:51.600000
      honest and progressive way, helping other women to achieve their own professional goals
   Segment 87
      0:08:51.600000 ---> 0:08:56
      and enjoyed a lifelong loving relationship with her would-be wife.

Transcription for audio8.mp3:
   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:05
      In this video, we will be discussing Matisse's painting, Blue Nude.
   Segment 2
      0:00:05 ---> 0:00:14.500000
      So, I think it's pretty clear that Matisse's painting is pretty avant-garde when it comes to formal strategies.
   Segment 3
      0:00:14.500000 ---> 0:00:21
      He's playing with arbitrary color, he's using shadow in a highly non-traditional fashion,
   Segment 4
      0:00:21 ---> 0:00:23
      he's playful with anatomy.
   Segment 5
      0:00:23 ---> 0:00:30.500000
      All of these aesthetic strategies sort of culminate in a general rebellion against artistic tradition.
   Segment 6
      0:00:30.500000 ---> 0:00:40
      However, can we think about Matisse's art as more than just aesthetically avant-garde, but also socially avant-garde?
   Segment 7
      0:00:40 ---> 0:00:46
      And if so, what are the limitations to that avant-gardeism?
   Segment 8
      0:00:46 ---> 0:00:52
      To think about that question, we're going to look at Matisse's Blue Nude from 1907.
   Segment 9
      0:00:52 ---> 0:00:59.500000
      This painting, it's thought, is in fact sort of inspired by one of the figures in the joy of life,
   Segment 10
      0:00:59.500000 ---> 0:01:05
      whose body is positioned quite similarly to what we see in Blue Nude.
   Segment 11
      0:01:05 ---> 0:01:13.500000
      Looking at a painting like this one, one could argue that what we're seeing here is an anti-bourgeois attitude about sexuality,
   Segment 12
      0:01:13.500000 ---> 0:01:19
      and that is an embrace of nudity that is not of the classical variety.
   Segment 13
      0:01:19 ---> 0:01:24
      What I mean by that is that it's not unusual in French art to see nude bodies,
   Segment 14
      0:01:24 ---> 0:01:32.500000
      but most typically we see those nude bodies in the context of Grecian or Roman mythology.
   Segment 15
      0:01:32.500000 ---> 0:01:37.500000
      More typically, for example, we might see a scene of the birth of Venus.
   Segment 16
      0:01:37.500000 ---> 0:01:45.500000
      Venus is born fully adult and emerges from the sea foam, riding a seashell onto the shore.
   Segment 17
      0:01:45.500000 ---> 0:01:52.500000
      She is of course nude in that she has just been born, but that's somehow different than being naked,
   Segment 18
      0:01:52.500000 ---> 0:01:56.500000
      which feels somehow a little less chaste.
   Segment 19
      0:01:56.500000 ---> 0:02:06.500000
      This embrace of non-classical nudity in art is, in a sense, agitating against or bucking against middle-class norms and values,
   Segment 20
      0:02:06.500000 ---> 0:02:10.500000
      which is one of the goals of the avant-garde politically.
   Segment 21
      0:02:10.500000 ---> 0:02:17.500000
      The belief was that middle-class norms and values become dominant in society,
   Segment 22
      0:02:17.500000 ---> 0:02:23.500000
      that notions of sexual morality and chastity were not in fact established by the ruling elite,
   Segment 23
      0:02:23.500000 ---> 0:02:27.500000
      but were norms set by the bourgeois class.
   Segment 24
      0:02:27.500000 ---> 0:02:34.500000
      And to challenge or to unsettle those norms can be seen in a sense as a political act.
   Segment 25
      0:02:34.500000 ---> 0:02:44.500000
      However, in this painting, Matisse is achieving that avant-garde status through the objectification of the woman represented.
   Segment 26
      0:02:44.500000 ---> 0:02:52.500000
      In blue nude, we see a nameless body, whose eyes are averted away from us, turned downward,
   Segment 27
      0:02:52.500000 ---> 0:02:55.500000
      allowing our gaze to take precedence.
   Segment 28
      0:02:55.500000 ---> 0:03:00.500000
      In art history, when we talk about the gaze, that can mean a couple of things.
   Segment 29
      0:03:00.500000 ---> 0:03:05.500000
      It can describe a person in a scene who makes eye contact with the viewer.
   Segment 30
      0:03:05.500000 ---> 0:03:12.500000
      For example, in Venus of Urbino, we look at the woman in the scene, and she returns our gaze.
   Segment 31
      0:03:12.500000 ---> 0:03:19.500000
      I think it's safe to say that we, the viewer, feel empowered in a sense to enjoy this painting,
   Segment 32
      0:03:19.500000 ---> 0:03:27.500000
      to take pleasure in the sensuality of the form of her body, the softness of the fabric, etc.
   Segment 33
      0:03:27.500000 ---> 0:03:37.500000
      But to a degree, there is an awareness in her eyes that suggests that she has some agency, some power here as well.
   Segment 34
      0:03:37.500000 ---> 0:03:44.500000
      She looks at us coily, seductively. She seems to be a participant in this sexual exchange.
   Segment 35
      0:03:44.500000 ---> 0:03:51.500000
      In contrast, in blue nude, the woman represented has no gaze of her own.
   Segment 36
      0:03:51.500000 ---> 0:03:53.500000
      Instead, she looks downward.
   Segment 37
      0:03:53.500000 ---> 0:04:01.500000
      The only gaze in this scene is the invisible gaze of the viewer, who feels, in this case, all powerful.
   Segment 38
      0:04:01.500000 ---> 0:04:06.500000
      We almost hover above her, looking down in a physically dominant way.
   Segment 39
      0:04:06.500000 ---> 0:04:14.500000
      Her form is distorted to highlight parts of her body more traditionally associated with sex and reproduction,
   Segment 40
      0:04:14.500000 ---> 0:04:17.500000
      namely the breast's hips buttocks.
   Segment 41
      0:04:17.500000 ---> 0:04:25.500000
      She is not painted here in a traditionally sensual way, according to the norms of European painting tradition.
   Segment 42
      0:04:25.500000 ---> 0:04:32.500000
      Looking at Titian-Svenus of Urbino, we can see a sort of soft, sinuous use of line.
   Segment 43
      0:04:32.500000 ---> 0:04:40.500000
      Her body is represented in a way where it almost feels boneless, flesh melting into the bed beneath her.
   Segment 44
      0:04:40.500000 ---> 0:04:47.500000
      In blue nude in comparison, the body is depicted in a way that reads as muscular, angular.
   Segment 45
      0:04:47.500000 ---> 0:04:57.500000
      Some have argued that this is in a sense avant-garde, in that it rejects the traditional ways in European art that women's bodies have traditionally been shown.
   Segment 46
      0:04:57.500000 ---> 0:05:05.500000
      However, although it is true that what we're seeing here is a non-traditional way of representing the body,
   Segment 47
      0:05:05.500000 ---> 0:05:12.500000
      it does not ultimately amount to a scene wherein the woman looks powerful.
   Segment 48
      0:05:12.500000 ---> 0:05:20.500000
      It is worth noting that at the end of the 19th century, women are increasingly agitating for more rights in Europe.
   Segment 49
      0:05:20.500000 ---> 0:05:28.500000
      This is first-way feminism, a movement that saw women push against the traditional norms that society had set for them.
   Segment 50
      0:05:28.500000 ---> 0:05:35.500000
      At a time when women were successfully advocating for themselves for the ability to pursue careers outside the home,
   Segment 51
      0:05:35.500000 ---> 0:05:41.500000
      for the right to venture outside unaccompanied, for the right to be seen as more than a mother,
   Segment 52
      0:05:41.500000 ---> 0:05:51.500000
      we nonetheless see in art of that time period an increasingly objectifying representation of women's bodies.
   Segment 53
      0:05:51.500000 ---> 0:06:03.500000
      Many art historians have argued that this is no coincidence, that in fact what we're seeing in art is a backlash against women's hard-fought and tenuous independence.
   Segment 54
      0:06:03.500000 ---> 0:06:09.500000
      On the one hand, there are clearly some gender power dynamics to think about in this painting Blue Nude.
   Segment 55
      0:06:09.500000 ---> 0:06:14.500000
      The title indicates that this is also an image about race and colonialism as well.
   Segment 56
      0:06:14.500000 ---> 0:06:20.500000
      The title of this painting Blue Nude and then in parentheses, Souvenir de Biscra,
   Segment 57
      0:06:20.500000 ---> 0:06:30.500000
      refers to a town called Biscra in northern Africa that was being colonized by France during the years in which Matisse was painting this image.
   Segment 58
      0:06:30.500000 ---> 0:06:40.500000
      Biscra was an oasis town often frequented by artists, but was also a site popularly associated in France with sex tourism.
   Segment 59
      0:06:41.500000 ---> 0:06:47.500000
      The title of this painting Souvenir de Biscra implicitly poses a disturbing question,
   Segment 60
      0:06:47.500000 ---> 0:06:53.500000
      is this painting Matisse's Souvenir de Biscra or is it this woman's body?
   Segment 61
      0:06:53.500000 ---> 0:06:59.500000
      Because of the title and the seemingly tropical plant life shown in the background of this image,
   Segment 62
      0:06:59.500000 ---> 0:07:05.500000
      art historians have connected this work to a phenomenon known as modernist primitivism.
   Segment 63
      0:07:06.500000 ---> 0:07:18.500000
      Modernist primitivism is a term that art historians use to describe the appropriation of non-Western art objects and aesthetics by modern artists in the West, like Matisse.
   Segment 64
      0:07:18.500000 ---> 0:07:25.500000
      These artists are appropriating styles and subject matters from cultures that they deem to be more primitive than their own.
   Segment 65
      0:07:25.500000 ---> 0:07:33.500000
      This tendency in modern art is, on the one hand, fully dependent upon the practice of colonialism.
   Segment 66
      0:07:33.500000 ---> 0:07:42.500000
      Again, Biscra is a town in a part of northern Africa that is being actively colonized by France during the years that Matisse paints this work.
   Segment 67
      0:07:42.500000 ---> 0:07:47.500000
      It is in this way intimately connected to the legacy of French colonial practices.
   Segment 68
      0:07:47.500000 ---> 0:07:58.500000
      It also, arguably, reflects a French attitude of entitlement to the art produced by and the bodies of individuals who are part of other cultures.
   Segment 69
      0:07:59.500000 ---> 0:08:13.500000
      And yet, on the other hand, paradoxically, the use of modernist primitivism by modern artists is often intended to be seen as an indictment of Western society, the society that colonizes.
   Segment 70
      0:08:13.500000 ---> 0:08:21.500000
      In that, it is a rejection of European tradition and taste, and it is therefore meant to be an avant-garde gesture.
   Segment 71
      0:08:21.500000 ---> 0:08:34.500000
      In that way, I think it would be fair to say that this is a painting that is attempting to be avant-garde in more than just matters of aesthetics, but rather is pushing against social norms set in place by French society.
   Segment 72
      0:08:34.500000 ---> 0:08:49.500000
      And yet, I think we would be well to ask ourselves for whom is this painting pushing society forward, who benefits from this avant-garde stance, and who is left objectified and powerless in its wake.
   Segment 73
      0:08:49.500000 ---> 0:08:56.500000
      In conclusion, foveism is often seen as one of the first avant-garde movements of the 20th century.
   Segment 74
      0:08:56.500000 ---> 0:09:09.500000
      And certainly, I think there are ways in which we can view this movement as avant-garde in terms of aesthetics, and to a degree in terms of its challenge to bourgeois norms.
   Segment 75
      0:09:09.500000 ---> 0:09:29.500000
      And yet, on the other hand, although I think there is a tendency to see modern art, to see avant-gardeism as inherently positive, as pushing society forward in a positive fashion, we should at least think about the limitations of that would be progressivism.
   Segment 76
      0:09:29.500000 ---> 0:09:34.500000
      Who is flattered by this avant-garde agitation, and who is painted as less than?

   Segment 1
      0:00:00 ---> 0:00:04.720000
      This video will talk about De Moiselle's Defignon by Picasso.
   Segment 2
      0:00:04.720000 ---> 0:00:12.040000
      Pablo Picasso was a fairly traditionally trained Spanish artist who arrived in Paris in 1902,
   Segment 3
      0:00:12.040000 ---> 0:00:16.080000
      hoping to ingratiate himself into the Parisian art world scene,
   Segment 4
      0:00:16.080000 ---> 0:00:20.640000
      which had, in many ways, become the center of the art world avant-garde.
   Segment 5
      0:00:20.640000 ---> 0:00:23.560000
      His integration into this world was a quick one,
   Segment 6
      0:00:23.560000 ---> 0:00:26.920000
      and he soon struck up a friendly rivalry with Matisse.
   Segment 7
      0:00:27 ---> 0:00:30.840000
      By 1907, when Picasso painted De Moiselle's Defignon,
   Segment 8
      0:00:30.840000 ---> 0:00:36.080000
      he was striving to challenge Matisse as the leader of the Parisian art scene.
   Segment 9
      0:00:36.560000 ---> 0:00:42.080000
      Looking at these two paintings side by side, they really couldn't be further apart.
   Segment 10
      0:00:42.080000 ---> 0:00:48.360000
      Matisse shows us a utopian outdoor world with bright colors and sensual forms.
   Segment 11
      0:00:48.360000 ---> 0:00:53.880000
      Although there are strange incongruencies in terms of scale, shading, and anatomy,
   Segment 12
      0:00:53.960000 ---> 0:00:58.360000
      these incongruencies present a pleasing challenge to the viewer.
   Segment 13
      0:00:58.360000 ---> 0:01:01.720000
      Picasso's De Moiselle's Defignon, in contrast,
   Segment 14
      0:01:01.720000 ---> 0:01:07.160000
      is a cramped interior scene with a muddy, disquieting color palette.
   Segment 15
      0:01:07.160000 ---> 0:01:11.720000
      Rather than feeling pleased, the viewer is left feeling uncomfortable,
   Segment 16
      0:01:11.720000 ---> 0:01:17.360000
      perhaps threatened by the intimidating gaze of the figures who stand before us.
   Segment 17
      0:01:17.360000 ---> 0:01:20.360000
      Thinking about this painting further in terms of form,
   Segment 18
      0:01:20.360000 ---> 0:01:24.120000
      we might consider the way that space is compressed.
   Segment 19
      0:01:24.120000 ---> 0:01:27.720000
      The heavy drapery feels as though it's closing in on us,
   Segment 20
      0:01:27.720000 ---> 0:01:30.480000
      giving the work a claustrophobic quality.
   Segment 21
      0:01:30.480000 ---> 0:01:34.120000
      Perspective rules seem altogether ignored.
   Segment 22
      0:01:34.120000 ---> 0:01:39.320000
      The table in the front of the composition feels rinshed up toward the viewer,
   Segment 23
      0:01:39.320000 ---> 0:01:42.920000
      parallel to the picture plane rather than perpendicular.
   Segment 24
      0:01:42.920000 ---> 0:01:46.520000
      The two central figures seem to be floating midair.
   Segment 25
      0:01:46.520000 ---> 0:01:49.160000
      Are they standing or are they lying down?
   Segment 26
      0:01:49.160000 ---> 0:01:53.960000
      Their bodies are positioned in a standard otolisk or venous pose,
   Segment 27
      0:01:53.960000 ---> 0:01:57.240000
      as if reclining on a bed or field.
   Segment 28
      0:01:57.240000 ---> 0:02:02.200000
      And yet, like the table, they too are pried from their recumbent position
   Segment 29
      0:02:02.200000 ---> 0:02:06.120000
      and pulled up so that the viewers might inspect them more readily.
   Segment 30
      0:02:06.120000 ---> 0:02:09.480000
      The anatomy is inconsistent and confusing.
   Segment 31
      0:02:09.480000 ---> 0:02:14.440000
      Looking at the figure on the lower right, it is difficult to discern
   Segment 32
      0:02:14.440000 ---> 0:02:18.600000
      whether we are seeing this figure from the front or the back.
   Segment 33
      0:02:18.600000 ---> 0:02:23.960000
      If from the back, we imagine the head spun 180 degrees around,
   Segment 34
      0:02:23.960000 ---> 0:02:26.920000
      like an owl inspecting her prey.
   Segment 35
      0:02:26.920000 ---> 0:02:31.720000
      The use of shading in this scene is more confounding than illustrative.
   Segment 36
      0:02:31.720000 ---> 0:02:35.560000
      The fabric is often dark where we might expect it to be light
   Segment 37
      0:02:35.560000 ---> 0:02:38.280000
      and light where we might expect it to be dark.
   Segment 38
      0:02:38.280000 ---> 0:02:40.760000
      Again, the colors are highly unappealing.
   Segment 39
      0:02:40.760000 ---> 0:02:44.760000
      Much of the flesh is painted in a muddy pepto-bismal pink.
   Segment 40
      0:02:44.760000 ---> 0:02:47.960000
      The possess is none of the joyfulness that we might feel
   Segment 41
      0:02:47.960000 ---> 0:02:49.960000
      looking at the joy of life.
   Segment 42
      0:02:49.960000 ---> 0:02:53.800000
      The fruit on the table in front of us is gray,
   Segment 43
      0:02:53.800000 ---> 0:02:57.640000
      more akin to rotting meat than grapes and apples,
   Segment 44
      0:02:57.640000 ---> 0:03:01.240000
      and we feel as though we might feel sick after eating it.
   Segment 45
      0:03:01.240000 ---> 0:03:07
      Whereas Matisse describes bodies with sensual, serpentine lines,
   Segment 46
      0:03:07 ---> 0:03:11.400000
      Picasso's bodies are angular and fragmented.
   Segment 47
      0:03:11.400000 ---> 0:03:15.640000
      This painting immediately created a splash in the Parisian art world.
   Segment 48
      0:03:15.640000 ---> 0:03:18.360000
      When Picasso first showed the poet Apollinare,
   Segment 49
      0:03:18.360000 ---> 0:03:22.520000
      he nervously worried that Picasso might get everyone in trouble
   Segment 50
      0:03:22.520000 ---> 0:03:24.440000
      because he had gone too far.
   Segment 51
      0:03:24.440000 ---> 0:03:28.200000
      Brock, Picasso's closest art world ally,
   Segment 52
      0:03:28.200000 ---> 0:03:31.880000
      referred to this painting as an anarchist bomb,
   Segment 53
      0:03:31.880000 ---> 0:03:34.920000
      suggesting that there was something inherently political
   Segment 54
      0:03:34.920000 ---> 0:03:38.120000
      and radical about his choices therein.
   Segment 55
      0:03:38.200000 ---> 0:03:43.720000
      Indeed, many art historians believe that Picasso may have had anarchist leanings.
   Segment 56
      0:03:43.720000 ---> 0:03:47.240000
      Many of the artists and intellectuals that he hung out with in Paris
   Segment 57
      0:03:47.240000 ---> 0:03:50.680000
      were, in fact, anarchists, and Barcelona,
   Segment 58
      0:03:50.680000 ---> 0:03:54.040000
      where he lived before coming to Paris, was chock full of them.
   Segment 59
      0:03:55.560000 ---> 0:03:59.560000
      The title of this painting, Les des Mozzels d'Avignon,
   Segment 60
      0:03:59.560000 ---> 0:04:04.360000
      refers to a street in Barcelona known for its brothels,
   Segment 61
      0:04:04.360000 ---> 0:04:07.160000
      the so-called red light district.
   Segment 62
      0:04:07.160000 ---> 0:04:10.280000
      The street was quite notorious throughout Europe
   Segment 63
      0:04:10.280000 ---> 0:04:14.200000
      and would have immediately conjured associations with sex work.
   Segment 64
      0:04:14.200000 ---> 0:04:16.680000
      By the time Picasso is painting this,
   Segment 65
      0:04:16.680000 ---> 0:04:20.680000
      it had become sort of a tradition for avant-garde artists
   Segment 66
      0:04:20.680000 ---> 0:04:24.600000
      to depict scenes of sex work as a strategy for shocking
   Segment 67
      0:04:24.600000 ---> 0:04:26.680000
      and pushing against the envelope.
   Segment 68
      0:04:27.240000 ---> 0:04:32.280000
      This was a form of avant-gardeism, not really available to women artists,
   Segment 69
      0:04:32.280000 ---> 0:04:36.040000
      and the avant-garde scene in general was heavily gendered.
   Segment 70
      0:04:36.120000 ---> 0:04:40.360000
      Male artists using the bodies of women as a tool for their avant-gardeism.
   Segment 71
      0:04:41.400000 ---> 0:04:46.520000
      Although Picasso's composition feels raw, crude, unfinished,
   Segment 72
      0:04:46.520000 ---> 0:04:50.280000
      perhaps hasty, it was, in fact, highly planned out
   Segment 73
      0:04:50.280000 ---> 0:04:53.720000
      in order to cultivate the ultimate discomfort in the viewer.
   Segment 74
      0:04:54.280000 ---> 0:04:57.320000
      Initially, there was a sailor in the center of the scene.
   Segment 75
      0:04:58.040000 ---> 0:05:01.320000
      Sailors were often included in scenes of sex work
   Segment 76
      0:05:01.400000 ---> 0:05:06.440000
      because they were heavily stereotyped as overly sexed up and ill-behaved.
   Segment 77
      0:05:06.440000 ---> 0:05:09
      When looking at the scene with the sailor included,
   Segment 78
      0:05:09.800000 ---> 0:05:13.080000
      the viewer can comfortably look at the sailor and say,
   Segment 79
      0:05:13.080000 ---> 0:05:15.560000
      aha, he is the corrupt one, not I.
   Segment 80
      0:05:16.600000 ---> 0:05:21.400000
      At one stage, the scene also included a medical student holding a skull.
   Segment 81
      0:05:22.040000 ---> 0:05:25.960000
      The skull was intended to function as a memento mori,
   Segment 82
      0:05:25.960000 ---> 0:05:29.320000
      a warning to the viewer that we too shall die one day.
   Segment 83
      0:05:30.200000 ---> 0:05:33.800000
      Picasso removed these figures, and as a consequence,
   Segment 84
      0:05:34.360000 ---> 0:05:37
      the viewer is placed in the position of the sailor.
   Segment 85
      0:05:37.560000 ---> 0:05:39
      Now, we are the customer.
   Segment 86
      0:05:39.720000 ---> 0:05:41.800000
      We are implicated in this exchange.
   Segment 87
      0:05:42.760000 ---> 0:05:45.960000
      Although there is no longer a literal reference to death,
   Segment 88
      0:05:45.960000 ---> 0:05:49.640000
      one still feels danger standing in front of this large canvas.
   Segment 89
      0:05:50.360000 ---> 0:05:54.520000
      In European society, sex workers were often demonized,
   Segment 90
      0:05:54.520000 ---> 0:05:57.720000
      associated with syphilis and other venereal disease,
   Segment 91
      0:05:57.800000 ---> 0:06:01.160000
      despite the fact that statistically it was more prevalent among men.
   Segment 92
      0:06:02.040000 ---> 0:06:05.960000
      In the final version, the women themselves are intended to be read
   Segment 93
      0:06:05.960000 ---> 0:06:07.720000
      as vectors of disease and death.
   Segment 94
      0:06:08.760000 ---> 0:06:13.640000
      This painting attacks the viewer and uses society's fear of women
   Segment 95
      0:06:13.640000 ---> 0:06:18.120000
      in order to make this explosive anarchist bomb, as Brock put it.
   Segment 96
      0:06:19.320000 ---> 0:06:24.440000
      In this work, Picasso heavily appropriates from ancient and non-western cultures,
   Segment 97
      0:06:25.080000 ---> 0:06:28.440000
      looking to African, oceanic, and Iberian art,
   Segment 98
      0:06:28.440000 ---> 0:06:31.960000
      particularly as he conceived of the faces in this scene.
   Segment 99
      0:06:32.440000 ---> 0:06:37.880000
      Picasso heavily collected non-western art and relied on it often as inspiration.
   Segment 100
      0:06:38.920000 ---> 0:06:44.440000
      In doing so, he strips these cultural objects from their initial meaning and function,
   Segment 101
      0:06:44.440000 ---> 0:06:47.400000
      arguably transforming them into mere aesthetics.
   Segment 102
      0:06:48.040000 ---> 0:06:52.600000
      Most of these objects possess specific cultural and religious uses
   Segment 103
      0:06:52.600000 ---> 0:06:54.360000
      that are here altogether ignored.
   Segment 104
      0:06:55.400000 ---> 0:06:59.400000
      At the same time, art historian Patricia Layton points out
   Segment 105
      0:06:59.400000 ---> 0:07:04.440000
      that de Muzelles-Devignon was produced right on the heels of news about atrocities
   Segment 106
      0:07:04.440000 ---> 0:07:07
      committed in the Congo by French colonists.
   Segment 107
      0:07:07.880000 ---> 0:07:13.320000
      European anarchists, in general, spoke and protested against colonialism.
   Segment 108
      0:07:14.120000 ---> 0:07:19.800000
      As such, Layton argues that perhaps Picasso was trying to confront French viewers
   Segment 109
      0:07:19.800000 ---> 0:07:22.440000
      with imagery that would remind them of their cruelty,
   Segment 110
      0:07:23 ---> 0:07:27.160000
      and imply that perhaps it was the French who were primitive all along.
   Segment 111
      0:07:28.440000 ---> 0:07:34.360000
      The art historian Linda Noklin, who was part of second-wave feminism in the 1970s and 80s,
   Segment 112
      0:07:34.360000 ---> 0:07:36.600000
      asked of the artist Corbe, quote,
   Segment 113
      0:07:37.160000 ---> 0:07:40.360000
      Why must transgression, social and artistic alike,
   Segment 114
      0:07:40.360000 ---> 0:07:43.400000
      always be enacted by men on the naked bodies of women?
   Segment 115
      0:07:44.360000 ---> 0:07:49.320000
      If this work is off on guard, if it is pushing society forward in some respect,
   Segment 116
      0:07:49.960000 ---> 0:07:54.520000
      for whom does it push society forward, who benefits and who is left behind?
   Segment 117
      0:07:55.720000 ---> 0:08:00.760000
      On the one hand, this work thumbs its nose at centuries-long formal traditions
   Segment 118
      0:08:01.480000 ---> 0:08:04.760000
      that have historically served to uphold power structures.
   Segment 119
      0:08:05.480000 ---> 0:08:11.160000
      It also might, as Patricia Layton argues, serve as a reminder to Europeans
   Segment 120
      0:08:11.160000 ---> 0:08:15
      of their own, quote, unquote, savagery, label more typically and
   Segment 121
      0:08:15 ---> 0:08:17.800000
      prejudicially assigned to non-Western cultures.
   Segment 122
