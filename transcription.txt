   Segment 2
      0:00:08.200000 ---> 0:00:14.520000
      Consider also picking up a new matte black mug, t-shirt, or one of the few remaining tank pins.

   Segment 4
      0:00:20.480000 ---> 0:00:26.200000
      A trio of German officers stand on the parapet of the Atlantic Wall.
   Segment 5
      0:00:26.200000 ---> 0:00:28.800000
      At their head is Erwin Rommel.
   Segment 6
      0:00:30.120000 ---> 0:00:54.900000
      It is certainly the moment when it isn't really a German
   Segment 7
      0:00:54.900000 ---> 0:01:02.180000
      The city of the Dodgland is the first to be known as the Londoner.
   Segment 8
      0:01:02.180000 ---> 0:01:07.340000
      The city of the Dodgland is the first to be known as the Dodgland.
   Segment 9
      0:01:07.340000 ---> 0:01:14.140000
      Hi, I'm Griffin Johnson, the armchair historian.
   Segment 10
      0:01:14.140000 ---> 0:01:20.340000
      The story of D-Day and its accompanying airborne and partisan operations is well known from
   Segment 11
      0:01:20.340000 ---> 0:01:25.780000
      the Allied perspective, but seldom is this critical juncture of the Second World War
   Segment 12
      0:01:25.780000 ---> 0:01:29.940000
      looked at through the eyes of those defending the Atlantic Wall.
   Segment 13
      0:01:29.940000 ---> 0:01:34.340000
      seldom are the stories of individual German soldiers studied.
   Segment 14
      0:01:34.340000 ---> 0:01:40.460000
      In today's episode, we will revisit our most popular video, D-Day from the German perspective,
   Segment 15
      0:01:40.460000 ---> 0:01:45.820000
      and bring you recollections from the men who saw the French sky darken with paratroopers
   Segment 16
      0:01:45.820000 ---> 0:01:52.420000
      and the English Channel team with battleships, and knew that the end of the Reich was at hand.
   Segment 17
      0:01:54.900000 ---> 0:01:56.580000
      Here's a quick question for you.
   Segment 18
      0:01:56.580000 ---> 0:02:01.540000
      What did George Patton, Albert Kesselring and Bernard Montgomery all have in common?
   Segment 19
      0:02:01.540000 ---> 0:02:06.500000
      Well, aside from being officers in the Second World War, they all suffered from unfortunate
   Segment 20
      0:02:06.500000 ---> 0:02:11.800000
      cases of male pattern baldness, and as we all know, those who fail to learn from history
   Segment 21
      0:02:11.800000 ---> 0:02:17.120000
      are doomed to repeat it, which is why today's video is sponsored by Kiebs, a subscription
   Segment 22
      0:02:17.120000 ---> 0:02:22.040000
      service focused on making it easy for men seeking treatment for baldness.
   Segment 23
      0:02:22.040000 ---> 0:02:27.280000
      Featuring 24-7 access to a licensed doctor with personalized treatment plans, affordable
   Segment 24
      0:02:27.280000 ---> 0:02:32.880000
      versions of FDA-approved medication, and more five-star reviews than any competitor, Kiebs
   Segment 25
      0:02:32.880000 ---> 0:02:37.640000
      is the obvious choice for any man interested in keeping his hairline intact during even
   Segment 26
      0:02:37.640000 ---> 0:02:40.600000
      the longest and most stressful campaign.

   Segment 30
      0:02:58.200000 ---> 0:03:03.240000
      The D-Day landings did not take the Germans completely by surprise.
   Segment 31
      0:03:03.240000 ---> 0:03:09.200000
      On the contrary, the highest echelons of German command were well aware that an invasion was
   Segment 32
      0:03:09.200000 ---> 0:03:12.680000
      imminent and of the least possible threat.
   Segment 33
      0:03:12.680000 ---> 0:03:17.840000
      The fuhrer was confident that the Atlantic Wall, stretching from the border of Spain
   Segment 34
      0:03:17.840000 ---> 0:03:23.520000
      to Norway would not only repulse any allied landing, but cause so many commonwealth and
   Segment 35
      0:03:23.520000 ---> 0:03:30.120000
      American casualties that the Western Allies would lose their capacity to continue the war.
   Segment 36
      0:03:30.120000 ---> 0:03:36.240000
      Fritz Byerlein, a senior aide to Erwin Rommel in Africa and later commander of the Panzer
   Segment 37
      0:03:36.320000 ---> 0:03:42.640000
      Lair division at Normandy held the debacle at D'Abbe up as incontrovertible proof the
   Segment 38
      0:03:42.640000 ---> 0:03:46.440000
      Allies could not manage an amphibious assault.
   Segment 39
      0:03:46.440000 ---> 0:03:52.880000
      The series of successful allied amphibious landings in Italy gave even Hitler pause, however,
   Segment 40
      0:03:52.880000 ---> 0:03:59.360000
      and he placed Rommel in charge of shoring up the defenses along the English Channel.
   Segment 41
      0:03:59.360000 ---> 0:04:02.160000
      Rommel's task was an inevitable one.
   Segment 42
      0:04:02.160000 ---> 0:04:07.400000
      The concrete was at a premium, with the lion's share of Germany's supply going to the construction
   Segment 43
      0:04:07.400000 ---> 0:04:11.640000
      of hardened U-boat shelters per Hitler's direct orders.
   Segment 44
      0:04:11.640000 ---> 0:04:17.640000
      French laborers and Italian POWs were conscripted to improve the defenses.
   Segment 45
      0:04:17.640000 ---> 0:04:23.240000
      Turrets from captured French tanks were made into makeshift emplacements named Tbrookes.
   Segment 46
      0:04:23.240000 ---> 0:04:28.500000
      After a jury-rigged reinforced firing pit, Italian soldiers had built with buried cement
   Segment 47
      0:04:28.500000 ---> 0:04:30.600000
      pipes in North Africa.
   Segment 48
      0:04:30.600000 ---> 0:04:33.200000
      And extensive minefields were laid.
   Segment 49
      0:04:33.200000 ---> 0:04:39.280000
      Perhaps Rommel's most ingenious inventions were the Rommel-Sparagos, or Rommel's Asparagus.
   Segment 50
      0:04:39.280000 ---> 0:04:45.080000
      Webs of metal wire strung along fields of short poles meant to shred gliders as they tried
   Segment 51
      0:04:45.080000 ---> 0:04:46.440000
      to land.
   Segment 52
      0:04:46.440000 ---> 0:04:52.920000
      Alongside anti-ship mines placed into the beaches atop angled poles driven into the sand.
   Segment 53
      0:04:52.920000 ---> 0:04:57.320000
      But static defenses were only part of Rommel's strategy.
   Segment 54
      0:04:57.320000 ---> 0:05:02.120000
      Rather and the high command had become convinced the Allies would land at the easy-to-reach
   Segment 55
      0:05:02.120000 ---> 0:05:04.120000
      Patek Le.
   Segment 56
      0:05:04.120000 ---> 0:05:10.100000
      Operatives confirmed this loudly and often, falling for the Allied deception operation,
   Segment 57
      0:05:10.100000 ---> 0:05:12.100000
      Operation Fortitude.
   Segment 58
      0:05:12.100000 ---> 0:05:17.140000
      Rommel, for his part, began to shift his view toward an Allied landing at Normandy.
   Segment 59
      0:05:17.140000 ---> 0:05:21.940000
      The beaches were similar to the Italian shore, and the Allies would want to maximize their
   Segment 60
      0:05:21.940000 ---> 0:05:26.360000
      chances of success by striking on familiar ground.
   Segment 61
      0:05:26.360000 ---> 0:05:31.160000
      Regardless of where the Allies came, Rommel argued that the only way to beat them back
   Segment 62
      0:05:31.160000 ---> 0:05:36.600000
      was through defensive action on the beaches, meeting the Allies as they landed and denying
   Segment 63
      0:05:36.600000 ---> 0:05:41.760000
      them the opportunity to take even a centimeter of ground.
   Segment 64
      0:05:41.760000 ---> 0:05:47.880000
      Given the quality of the troops defending Normandy, this was far easier planned than executed.
   Segment 65
      0:05:47.880000 ---> 0:05:52.440000
      Normandy was the responsibility of the Seventh Army, whose units in the area were, to put
   Segment 66
      0:05:52.440000 ---> 0:05:55.560000
      it mildly, of mixed quality.
   Segment 67
      0:05:55.560000 ---> 0:06:00.880000
      Promising recruits were siphoned off by SS, Falschimeger, or Panzer recruiters, leaving
   Segment 68
      0:06:00.880000 ---> 0:06:04.680000
      a contingent of unfit or unremarkable men.
   Segment 69
      0:06:04.680000 ---> 0:06:09.600000
      Among the defenders of Normandy were the so-called Ear and Stomach battalions, composed
   Segment 70
      0:06:09.600000 ---> 0:06:15.120000
      of soldiers convalescing from combat wounds to their abdomens, or who were experiencing
   Segment 71
      0:06:15.120000 ---> 0:06:21.400000
      hearing loss, and Osttroopan, foreign auxiliaries from conquered lands forced to fight for the
   Segment 72
      0:06:21.400000 ---> 0:06:24.840000
      Reich, including many Soviet POWs.
   Segment 73
      0:06:24.840000 ---> 0:06:30
      Naturally, most proved highly ineffective, with many deserting to join the French resistance
   Segment 74
      0:06:30 ---> 0:06:33.880000
      or surrendering to the Allies at the first opportunity.
   Segment 75
      0:06:33.880000 ---> 0:06:39.400000
      The few capable soldiers either suffered from endemic fatalism, such as Captain Abraham
   Segment 76
      0:06:39.400000 ---> 0:06:43.800000
      Vigamond, of the 21st Panzer Division who commented, we were well aware that neither
   Segment 77
      0:06:43.800000 ---> 0:06:49.120000
      our men nor our tanks were good enough, or were almost fanatically prepared to meet their
   Segment 78
      0:06:49.120000 ---> 0:06:50.120000
      foes.
   Segment 79
      0:06:50.120000 ---> 0:07:05.560000
      This attitude was usually invinced by the younger SS troops.
   Segment 80
      0:07:05.560000 ---> 0:07:11.800000
      As June 5th crept into June 6th, the Kriegsmarine pulled patrols from the English Channel.
   Segment 81
      0:07:11.800000 ---> 0:07:17.520000
      German meteorologists had declared the weather unsuitable for an invasion through June 10th.
   Segment 82
      0:07:17.520000 ---> 0:07:21.800000
      There was, scientifically speaking, no chance of a landing.
   Segment 83
      0:07:21.800000 ---> 0:07:27.080000
      Rommel took these assurances as an opportunity to go on leave, returning to Germany to celebrate
   Segment 84
      0:07:27.080000 ---> 0:07:31.680000
      his wife's birthday and arrange an audience with Hitler to request additional panzers
   Segment 85
      0:07:31.680000 ---> 0:07:34.080000
      along the wall.
   Segment 86
      0:07:34.080000 ---> 0:07:39.280000
      Friedrich Duhlmann, commander of the 7th Army, ordered a command post-drill for his officers
   Segment 87
      0:07:39.280000 ---> 0:07:40.800000
      on June 6th.
   Segment 88
      0:07:40.800000 ---> 0:07:46.120000
      The evening was shaping up to be a quiet affair, and the Germans began preparing for the next
   Segment 89
      0:07:46.120000 ---> 0:07:51.080000
      day's routine, until Allied bombs began falling.
   Segment 90
      0:07:51.080000 ---> 0:07:56.120000
      This itself was not unusual, as the Allies had launched near continuous runs against
   Segment 91
      0:07:56.120000 ---> 0:08:02.360000
      the Germans for some time, but this raid was an overture to Operation Overlord.
   Segment 92
      0:08:02.360000 ---> 0:08:07.920000
      As centuries fought off sleep, gliders began to make silent landings, as officers crawled
   Segment 93
      0:08:07.920000 ---> 0:08:12.320000
      into bed, paratroopers began to descend to Earth.
   Segment 94
      0:08:12.320000 ---> 0:08:16.800000
      The bewildered German commanders found enemies literally raining down on their heads, and
   Segment 95
      0:08:16.800000 ---> 0:08:22.720000
      desperately rang to their superiors or assembled cells of ad hoc resistance.
   Segment 96
      0:08:22.720000 ---> 0:08:28.120000
      Lieutenant General Josef Riker, commander of the 711th Infantry Division, recalled a
   Segment 97
      0:08:28.120000 ---> 0:08:32.640000
      night of drinking in the officer's mess, ending in combat.
   Segment 98
      0:08:32.640000 ---> 0:08:38.320000
      The enabriated officer, pistol in hand, stumbled out into the night to find British paratroopers
   Segment 99
      0:08:38.320000 ---> 0:08:42.040000
      raining down on the 711th command post.
   Segment 100
      0:08:42.040000 ---> 0:08:46.600000
      Riker and his men were able to fend off the assault, and be still drunk general desperately
   Segment 101
      0:08:46.600000 ---> 0:08:51.200000
      rang to his superiors to announce the beginning of the Allied invasion.
   Segment 102
      0:08:51.200000 ---> 0:08:55.880000
      In the American landing zones, Lieutenant General Wilhelm Folly, commander of the 91st
   Segment 103
      0:08:55.880000 ---> 0:09:01.520000
      Luftlanda Division, was ambushed and killed by the 82nd Airborne just behind his headquarters
   Segment 104
      0:09:01.520000 ---> 0:09:04.160000
      near Solmei-Iglé.
   Segment 105
      0:09:04.160000 ---> 0:09:07.280000
      Other Germans proved less willing to give battle.
   Segment 106
      0:09:07.280000 ---> 0:09:12.400000
      Liner Hartmeth's, a soldier serving near Normandy, rushed to his command post to find
   Segment 107
      0:09:12.400000 ---> 0:09:15.440000
      his officers gripped by battle shock.
   Segment 108
      0:09:15.440000 ---> 0:09:20.400000
      Two men were simply catatonic, while Reiner's company commander was sprawled drunkenly in
   Segment 109
      0:09:20.400000 ---> 0:09:21.800000
      a foxhole.
   Segment 110
      0:09:21.800000 ---> 0:09:25.720000
      Every time a runner brought news from the front line, the commander would idly threaten to
   Segment 111
      0:09:25.720000 ---> 0:09:31.240000
      execute anyone who returned to the scene of the action.
   Segment 112
      0:09:31.240000 ---> 0:09:36.560000
      As Don began to light up the Normandy coast, the Germans were shocked to see an Allied
   Segment 113
      0:09:36.560000 ---> 0:09:39.200000
      Armada steaming toward them.
   Segment 114
      0:09:39.200000 ---> 0:09:44.600000
      With no naval forces to challenge them, the Allied landing craft and their escorts took
   Segment 115
      0:09:44.600000 ---> 0:09:47.600000
      up their positions in the English Channel.
   Segment 116
      0:09:47.600000 ---> 0:10:02.720000
      And that's when the shells began landing.
   Segment 117
      0:10:02.720000 ---> 0:10:07.480000
      The opening bombardment of Omaha Beach caught German shore batteries in the middle of preparing
   Segment 118
      0:10:07.480000 ---> 0:10:11.920000
      for gunnery practice, turning what should have been a morning of plinking in the Atlantic
   Segment 119
      0:10:11.920000 ---> 0:10:14.920000
      into a scramble for survival.
   Segment 120
      0:10:14.920000 ---> 0:10:20.680000
      Weathering this bombardment was the 716th Static Infantry Division, a unit of notoriously
   Segment 121
      0:10:20.680000 ---> 0:10:21.680000
      low quality.
   Segment 122
      0:10:21.680000 ---> 0:10:26.880000
      Composed of decrepit or boyish conscripts and ill-motivated Ost-Truppen, the division
   Segment 123
      0:10:26.880000 ---> 0:10:31.960000
      was denied the usual allotment of artillery and heavy vehicles their peers in the army
   Segment 124
      0:10:31.960000 ---> 0:10:37.680000
      enjoyed, relying on a hodgepodge of German armaments and foreign heavy weapons.
   Segment 125
      0:10:37.680000 ---> 0:10:43.560000
      But the 716th was not alone at Omaha, as other areas were defended by the much more powerful
   Segment 126
      0:10:43.560000 ---> 0:10:46.560000
      352nd Infantry Division.
   Segment 127
      0:10:46.560000 ---> 0:10:51.040000
      As battle was joined on the beach and American servicemen scrambled for cover, machine gunner
   Segment 128
      0:10:51.040000 ---> 0:10:57.240000
      Heinrich Zavalo of the 352nd could see the water spouts where my machine gun bursts were
   Segment 129
      0:10:57.240000 ---> 0:11:02.960000
      hitting, and when the little fountains got close to the GIs they threw themselves down.
   Segment 130
      0:11:02.960000 ---> 0:11:07.560000
      They lay in the shallow water, many tried to get to the most forward beach obstacles
   Segment 131
      0:11:07.560000 ---> 0:11:09.800000
      to find some cover behind them.
   Segment 132
      0:11:09.800000 ---> 0:11:13.520000
      I fired some more at the many dark foams in the water.
   Segment 133
      0:11:13.520000 ---> 0:11:19
      Zavalo's senior, one Lieutenant Freierking, pitied the Americans as poor swine, even as
   Segment 134
      0:11:19 ---> 0:11:23.360000
      he called more artillery strikes onto the floundering infantry.
   Segment 135
      0:11:23.360000 ---> 0:11:28.840000
      All over the beach, Zavalo could see wounded moving around on the bloody, watery slime,
   Segment 136
      0:11:28.840000 ---> 0:11:33.320000
      mostly creeping, trying to get to the upper beach and find some cover behind the shingle
   Segment 137
      0:11:33.320000 ---> 0:11:34.840000
      embankment.
   Segment 138
      0:11:34.840000 ---> 0:11:39.360000
      One by one they would occasionally run in a crouch.
   Segment 139
      0:11:39.360000 ---> 0:11:44.360000
      As the day went on, men like Zavalo and their heavy weaponry would make Omaha the deadliest
   Segment 140
      0:11:44.360000 ---> 0:11:46.360000
      landing on D-Day.
   Segment 141
      0:11:46.360000 ---> 0:12:04.440000
      The 716th Division at Sword Beach was a sorry affair.
   Segment 142
      0:12:04.440000 ---> 0:12:09.600000
      The overstretched Germans were severely lacking in air support or completed fortifications
   Segment 143
      0:12:09.600000 ---> 0:12:14.400000
      and had utterly failed to coordinate with coastal artillery in their sector.
   Segment 144
      0:12:14.400000 ---> 0:12:19.240000
      The area teamed with vacation homes and coastal settlements and saved for some emplacements
   Segment 145
      0:12:19.240000 ---> 0:12:25.720000
      in the sand dunes and a handful of beach obstacles was largely undeveloped.
   Segment 146
      0:12:25.720000 ---> 0:12:31.120000
      The individual soldiers were also of low quality with Lieutenant Carl Heide bemoaning the condition
   Segment 147
      0:12:31.120000 ---> 0:12:33.800000
      of his division's officers.
   Segment 148
      0:12:33.800000 ---> 0:12:36.800000
      Many had been severely wounded previously.
   Segment 149
      0:12:36.800000 ---> 0:12:42.360000
      Some became unpleasant or socially inept due to their early harsh war experiences.
   Segment 150
      0:12:42.360000 ---> 0:12:46.040000
      I will not deny that some did get drunk at times.
   Segment 151
      0:12:46.040000 ---> 0:12:53.080000
      Lieutenant Schaff of the 716th noted that the rank and file were overworked and ill-motivated,
   Segment 152
      0:12:53.080000 ---> 0:12:58.760000
      too busy putting up wire and planting rumbles asparagus to have much time for training.
   Segment 153
      0:12:58.760000 ---> 0:13:04.280000
      Indeed, the mix of Germans and Ostruppen defending Sword Beach routinely invinced a
   Segment 154
      0:13:04.280000 ---> 0:13:09.680000
      lack of care, as artilleryman Hans Glaub describes his fellow gunners failing to keep
   Segment 155
      0:13:09.680000 ---> 0:13:12.760000
      their pieces clean.
   Segment 156
      0:13:12.760000 ---> 0:13:17.160000
      Sword would prove to be a relatively smooth landing, with the Germans yielding the beach
   Segment 157
      0:13:17.160000 ---> 0:13:21
      to British forces with minimum casualties.
   Segment 158
      0:13:21 ---> 0:13:25.920000
      Their attitude would change when they met the more professional soldiers of the 21st Panzer
   Segment 159
      0:13:25.920000 ---> 0:13:31.240000
      Division launching a two-pronged counterattack to the east and west of Sword.
   Segment 160
      0:13:31.240000 ---> 0:13:35.840000
      However, Major Hans von Leuch, commander of the Eastern Thrust, wrote in his memoir
   Segment 161
      0:13:35.840000 ---> 0:13:41.560000
      Panzer Commander of attempting to lead the second battalion of the 21st against dug-in
   Segment 162
      0:13:41.560000 ---> 0:14:03.600000
      British paratroopers only to be stymied by Allied aircraft and naval fire.
   Segment 163
      0:14:03.600000 ---> 0:14:09.080000
      The German defense at Utah Beach was compromised by the airborne operations.
   Segment 164
      0:14:09.080000 ---> 0:14:13.720000
      Cut phone lines had crippled their ability to exchange information, while the spread-out
   Segment 165
      0:14:13.720000 ---> 0:14:18.440000
      landing zones made mounting a large-scale defense difficult.
   Segment 166
      0:14:18.440000 ---> 0:14:24.400000
      Utah and its environs were defended primarily by the 709th Infantry Division, made up of
   Segment 167
      0:14:24.400000 ---> 0:14:30.240000
      older Germans and the ever-ubiquitous Ostruppen armed with a bizarre mix of weapons.
   Segment 168
      0:14:30.240000 ---> 0:14:35.640000
      French, German, Polish, even Russian armaments filled their stores, but blessed with competent
   Segment 169
      0:14:35.640000 ---> 0:14:37.760000
      leadership at least.
   Segment 170
      0:14:37.760000 ---> 0:14:42.880000
      Lieutenant General Karl Wilhelm Graf von Schleben, overall commander of the 709th would
   Segment 171
      0:14:42.880000 ---> 0:14:47.480000
      order an actual organized counterattack in the face of the airborne assault, arranging
   Segment 172
      0:14:47.480000 ---> 0:14:53.960000
      for the 100th Panzer Battalion to drive forward to meet the 82nd Airborne at Salmar Iglay,
   Segment 173
      0:14:53.960000 ---> 0:14:57.320000
      and at their critical bridgehead over the Maraday.
   Segment 174
      0:14:57.320000 ---> 0:15:02.680000
      The 100th would be driven back by the 82nd in spectacular fashion as the obsolete French
   Segment 175
      0:15:02.680000 ---> 0:15:09.120000
      tanks they deployed against the Americans were annihilated with bazookas and gamin grenades.
   Segment 176
      0:15:09.120000 ---> 0:15:12.920000
      But the 82nd were not the only paratroopers in the area.
   Segment 177
      0:15:12.920000 ---> 0:15:18.360000
      The 6th paratrooper regiment under the command of Major von der Heiter pushed out of Carantar
   Segment 178
      0:15:18.360000 ---> 0:15:21.760000
      to reinforce their ground-based colleagues.
   Segment 179
      0:15:21.760000 ---> 0:15:26.040000
      As they came upon the American's landing zones, the Germans were astonished at the
   Segment 180
      0:15:26.040000 ---> 0:15:29
      number of parachutes left behind.
   Segment 181
      0:15:29 ---> 0:15:31.960000
      Yards and yards of silk littered the fields of France.
   Segment 182
      0:15:31.960000 ---> 0:15:36.880000
      The Fauciemieger would push onto the commune Sankom Dumont, where Heiter climbed the church
   Segment 183
      0:15:36.880000 ---> 0:15:45.120000
      steeple and saw the endless Armada in the channel.
   Segment 184
      0:15:45.120000 ---> 0:15:48.520000
      Things were not much better for the Germans on the beach proper.
   Segment 185
      0:15:48.520000 ---> 0:15:55.400000
      Lieutenant Arthur Janke commanded Fort W5, a network of bunkers and pillboxes built into
   Segment 186
      0:15:55.400000 ---> 0:16:00.640000
      the dunes over the beaches, which was all but destroyed by the morning bombings.
   Segment 187
      0:16:00.640000 ---> 0:16:04.320000
      Janke recalled how the raids obliterated his position.
   Segment 188
      0:16:04.320000 ---> 0:16:10.080000
      Avelanches of sand and concrete buried his men alive, forcing them to be dug out even
   Segment 189
      0:16:10.080000 ---> 0:16:17.960000
      as the assault on the beaches began.
   Segment 190
      0:16:17.960000 ---> 0:16:22.960000
      Spotting the American landing craft, Janke ordered what men he could rally to dig in and
   Segment 191
      0:16:22.960000 ---> 0:16:28.480000
      ordered a dispatch rider to make for the nearest artillery battery to shell the beach.
   Segment 192
      0:16:28.480000 ---> 0:16:33.600000
      Janke's rider would be intercepted by American paratroopers.
   Segment 193
      0:16:33.600000 ---> 0:16:38.600000
      There was little Janke and his men could do as the landings began in Ernst.
   Segment 194
      0:16:38.600000 ---> 0:16:42.760000
      With men and floating tanks fighting their way through the surf and straight toward the
   Segment 195
      0:16:42.760000 ---> 0:16:45.280000
      ruins of W5.
   Segment 196
      0:16:45.280000 ---> 0:16:50.120000
      A blast knocked Janke to the ground, and as his eyes fought to focus and the ringing in
   Segment 197
      0:16:50.160000 ---> 0:16:55.320000
      his ears subsided, he looked up through his skewed spectacles to see an American infantryman
   Segment 198
      0:16:55.320000 ---> 0:17:08.160000
      standing over him.
   Segment 199
      0:17:08.160000 ---> 0:17:13.200000
      As combat intensified on Normandy and reports of paratroopers and an allied fleet flooded
   Segment 200
      0:17:13.200000 ---> 0:17:16.720000
      high command, the general staff thought to themselves.
   Segment 201
      0:17:16.720000 ---> 0:17:19.160000
      This is all an elaborate ruse.
   Segment 202
      0:17:19.160000 ---> 0:17:23.680000
      The general staff passed this thought around as Hitler slept in.
   Segment 203
      0:17:23.680000 ---> 0:17:28.520000
      As more and more allied troops and heavy equipment began making their way onto the beaches, Hitler
   Segment 204
      0:17:28.520000 ---> 0:17:33.600000
      finally rolled out of bed to be met with word of the invasion of France.
   Segment 205
      0:17:33.600000 ---> 0:17:36
      The furor could not have been happier.
   Segment 206
      0:17:36 ---> 0:17:40.520000
      Hitler declared again that the Atlantic wall would throw the allies back and he eagerly
   Segment 207
      0:17:40.520000 ---> 0:17:45.520000
      anticipated following up the inevitable failure of the Normandy landings by reigning V1 bombs
   Segment 208
      0:17:45.520000 ---> 0:17:47.160000
      on London.
   Segment 209
      0:17:47.160000 ---> 0:17:51.800000
      The Western armies would be ground into the sands of France, and the seat of his hated
   Segment 210
      0:17:51.800000 ---> 0:17:56.560000
      British enemies would be blown to smithereens by superior German weaponry.
   Segment 211
      0:17:56.560000 ---> 0:18:01.640000
      But as the day dragged on and the allies began to gain ground, the frontline commanders flooded
   Segment 212
      0:18:01.640000 ---> 0:18:06.920000
      high command with requests for support, requests to do something to prevent their positions
   Segment 213
      0:18:06.920000 ---> 0:18:08.800000
      from being overrun.
   Segment 214
      0:18:08.800000 ---> 0:18:14.120000
      The beacons of Normandy were lit, but high command would not answer the call for aid.
   Segment 215
      0:18:14.120000 ---> 0:18:19
      Hitler, the only man on earth who could release the panzers, would continue to insist that
   Segment 216
      0:18:19 ---> 0:18:35
      the allies could and should be thrown back on the shore.
   Segment 217
      0:18:35 ---> 0:18:39.800000
      This thinking had managed to seep into some of the defenders on Gold Beach.
   Segment 218
      0:18:39.800000 ---> 0:18:45.720000
      Friedrich Verster helped crew a battery of four captured Czech cannons at Marie Fontaine
   Segment 219
      0:18:45.720000 ---> 0:18:47.160000
      near the beach.
   Segment 220
      0:18:47.160000 ---> 0:18:52.160000
      Verster firmly agreed with his furor that the Atlantic wall was impenetrable, an attitude
   Segment 221
      0:18:52.160000 ---> 0:18:56.600000
      he kept right up until the British overran his commander's spawning position near the
   Segment 222
      0:18:56.600000 ---> 0:18:57.600000
      shore.
   Segment 223
      0:18:57.600000 ---> 0:19:02.520000
      In the face of Allied superiority in men and material, Verster and his fellows quietly
   Segment 224
      0:19:02.520000 ---> 0:19:04.120000
      surrendered.
   Segment 225
      0:19:04.120000 ---> 0:19:08.880000
      Further behind the lines, the Germans were hard at work trying to corral the French civilian
   Segment 226
      0:19:08.880000 ---> 0:19:10.480000
      population.
   Segment 227
      0:19:10.480000 ---> 0:19:14.840000
      Propaganda vans drove through calm, ordering the population to remain indoors while the
   Segment 228
      0:19:14.840000 ---> 0:19:20
      German authorities began to arrange for the evacuation of key parts of the city.
   Segment 229
      0:19:20 ---> 0:19:24.720000
      At von Rünstät's headquarters outside of Paris, telephones rang continuously and
   Segment 230
      0:19:24.720000 ---> 0:19:28.960000
      teletypes spewed seemingly infinite messages.
   Segment 231
      0:19:28.960000 ---> 0:19:34.880000
      Combat at Gold Beach began in Ernst when the first landing craft dropped their ramps.
   Segment 232
      0:19:34.880000 ---> 0:19:39.040000
      At a moment the metal hit the surf, German machine guns and artillery opened up on the
   Segment 233
      0:19:39.040000 ---> 0:19:40.040000
      British troops.
   Segment 234
      0:19:40.040000 ---> 0:19:44.520000
      Who fought hard to clear the beach and sweep the fortified coastal houses, the Germans
   Segment 235
      0:19:44.520000 ---> 0:19:46.800000
      had worked into their defenses.
   Segment 236
      0:19:46.800000 ---> 0:19:52.560000
      Indeed, the Germans put up a fierce fight at Gold, with elements of the 352nd infantry
   Segment 237
      0:19:52.560000 ---> 0:19:57.640000
      raining fire on the British from a cliff top over the beach at Amelle, including devastating
   Segment 238
      0:19:57.640000 ---> 0:20:00.320000
      valleys from a Flak 88.
   Segment 239
      0:20:00.320000 ---> 0:20:05
      And British were only able to unseat the Germans at Amelle with tank support, including
   Segment 240
      0:20:05 ---> 0:20:18.040000
      a mortar-armed member of Hobart's Funnies.
   Segment 241
      0:20:18.040000 ---> 0:20:22.800000
      Elements of the 12th SS division spotted the invasion fleet anchored off of Juneau Beach
   Segment 242
      0:20:22.800000 ---> 0:20:24.600000
      in the early morning hours.
   Segment 243
      0:20:24.600000 ---> 0:20:30.600000
      Lieutenant Peter Hansmann of the 12th recalled being awoken by his NCO in charge shaking
   Segment 244
      0:20:30.600000 ---> 0:20:31.960000
      my shoulders.
   Segment 245
      0:20:31.960000 ---> 0:20:35.240000
      Herloidnacht the invasion has started.
   Segment 246
      0:20:35.240000 ---> 0:20:38.560000
      Hansmann rushed to a vantage point near Gold Beach.
   Segment 247
      0:20:38.560000 ---> 0:20:43.600000
      Looking through my binoculars, I recognized the individual outlines of ships.
   Segment 248
      0:20:43.600000 ---> 0:20:49.320000
      At irregular intervals, flashes of ships artillery were coming from various spots.
   Segment 249
      0:20:49.320000 ---> 0:20:54.480000
      Fast boats with high, white, foamy bow waves were spitting out brown clumps of men on the
   Segment 250
      0:20:54.480000 ---> 0:20:55.600000
      beach.
   Segment 251
      0:20:55.600000 ---> 0:21:00.760000
      The Lieutenant counted over 400 ships in the channel from his front row seat to the end
   Segment 252
      0:21:00.760000 ---> 0:21:02.560000
      of the Third Reich.
   Segment 253
      0:21:02.560000 ---> 0:21:07.440000
      I wanted to shout at all the generals right up to Adolf Hitler over here quickly before
   Segment 254
      0:21:07.440000 ---> 0:21:08.440000
      it's too late.
   Segment 255
      0:21:08.440000 ---> 0:21:10.240000
      Whoever can still fight, come here.
   Segment 256
      0:21:10.240000 ---> 0:21:13.360000
      The fastest, most powerful divisions send them here.
   Segment 257
      0:21:13.360000 ---> 0:21:14.760000
      The Luftwaffe, where is it?
   Segment 258
      0:21:14.760000 ---> 0:21:16.400000
      The Kriegsmarine, where is it?
   Segment 259
      0:21:16.400000 ---> 0:21:18.920000
      It must get here.
   Segment 260
      0:21:18.920000 ---> 0:21:25.480000
      Grenadier Hans Weiner, who defended a position on Juno dubbed WN-31, recalled watching.
   Segment 261
      0:21:25.480000 ---> 0:21:29.240000
      The first Tommy's jumping into the sea, which was quite shallow.
   Segment 262
      0:21:29.240000 ---> 0:21:33.760000
      The bullets hit them and their boats, to good effect, and I was a little surprised to see
   Segment 263
      0:21:33.760000 ---> 0:21:34.760000
      them falling.
   Segment 264
      0:21:34.760000 ---> 0:21:36.840000
      I don't know why.
   Segment 265
      0:21:36.840000 ---> 0:21:41.240000
      Weiner's position was eventually torn apart by the tanks coming ashore with the Canadians,
   Segment 266
      0:21:41.240000 ---> 0:21:46.720000
      which managed to drive inland under the barrel of 88mm cannons poised to shred them as they
   Segment 267
      0:21:46.720000 ---> 0:21:48.880000
      emerged from the surf.
   Segment 268
      0:21:48.880000 ---> 0:21:53.560000
      The 88mm gunner, Hyrich Zebel, complained of not being able to see many tanks due to
   Segment 269
      0:21:53.560000 ---> 0:21:58.200000
      the smoke and chaos, though his gun claimed at least two Allied tanks before their block
   Segment 270
      0:21:58.200000 ---> 0:22:02.840000
      house too was blown apart.
   Segment 271
      0:22:02.840000 ---> 0:22:07.960000
      The Germans provided a much tougher obstacle for their foes at the Tiviel Chateau, roughly
   Segment 272
      0:22:07.960000 ---> 0:22:11.320000
      one mile or one and a half kilometers inland.
   Segment 273
      0:22:11.320000 ---> 0:22:16
      Tiviel was supposed to be the starting point for a second line of defensive works laid
   Segment 274
      0:22:16.040000 ---> 0:22:19.320000
      out by Rommel before the Allied landings came.
   Segment 275
      0:22:19.320000 ---> 0:22:24.680000
      It was a well-built strong point, with a full communication and command complex and underground
   Segment 276
      0:22:24.680000 ---> 0:22:30.160000
      tunnels connecting it to Tobruk turrets armed with machine guns, cannons and mortars.
   Segment 277
      0:22:30.160000 ---> 0:22:35.240000
      The defenders managed to hold the Allies back until nearly 6pm that day, with their final
   Segment 278
      0:22:35.240000 ---> 0:22:40.520000
      message before the position was taken, reading, hand-to-hand fighting inside the command post,
   Segment 279
      0:22:40.520000 ---> 0:22:44.200000
      slammed into a closely confined area, but still holding out.
   Segment 280
      0:22:44.200000 ---> 0:22:46.560000
      High Hitler.
   Segment 281
      0:22:46.560000 ---> 0:22:51.200000
      Not long after the fall of Tiviel, the Canadians began making their way toward the Luftwaffe
   Segment 282
      0:22:51.200000 ---> 0:22:54.960000
      airfield at Copichet, one of their key objectives.
   Segment 283
      0:22:54.960000 ---> 0:23:00.200000
      The Comandante of the airfield ordered an evacuation, inciting panic in his ground crews.
   Segment 284
      0:23:00.200000 ---> 0:23:04.440000
      The Germans made a hurried attempt to destroy the aircraft before they evacuated, but their
   Segment 285
      0:23:04.440000 ---> 0:23:06.440000
      haste proved fatal.
   Segment 286
      0:23:06.440000 ---> 0:23:12.120000
      Those two raised the airfield left most of the taxiing area of the runway untouched.
   Segment 287
      0:23:12.120000 ---> 0:23:17.320000
      The takeoff runway was damaged but not sufficiently to render it unusable, and the vast majority
   Segment 288
      0:23:17.320000 ---> 0:23:21.080000
      of the field's fuel stores were salvageable.
   Segment 289
      0:23:21.080000 ---> 0:23:25.680000
      In this one case, haste ended up lessening waste.
   Segment 290
      0:23:25.680000 ---> 0:23:37.840000
      From the invasion of Poland, all the way up until D-Day, the story of the Second World
   Segment 291
      0:23:37.840000 ---> 0:23:44.440000
      War is told from the perspective of the ascendant Nazi Germany, the bronze eagle casting a wide
   Segment 292
      0:23:44.440000 ---> 0:23:47.560000
      shadow over the history of the early war.
   Segment 293
      0:23:47.560000 ---> 0:23:52.880000
      But from the very moment the first Allied boot makes landfall in Normandy, the narrative
   Segment 294
      0:23:52.880000 ---> 0:23:59.280000
      changes and the rest of the war is studied almost exclusively from the Allied perspective.
   Segment 295
      0:23:59.280000 ---> 0:24:05.040000
      We hope you have enjoyed hearing these personal recollections from German soldiers on Normandy
   Segment 296
      0:24:05.040000 ---> 0:24:09.700000
      and agree with us that it is important to know the thoughts of even those on the wrong
   Segment 297
      0:24:09.700000 ---> 0:24:15.680000
      side of history, for it is only by seeing both sides of a conflict that one can form
   Segment 298
      0:24:15.680000 ---> 0:24:16.680000
      a complete picture.
